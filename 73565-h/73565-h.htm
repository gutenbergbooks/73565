<p class="ph2">CARLOTA OF THE RANCHO</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>BORDER LAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“My head is in the United States and my feet
are in Mexico!” cried Carlos sprawling at ease
upon the sun-warmed grass.</p>

<p>Whereupon Carlota, not to be outdone in anything,
promptly rolled her plump little person
over the sward until its length lay along a lime-line
running due east and west across the plain.
Her yellow curls touched her twin’s yet her
body formed a right angle to his. Then she
remarked:</p>

<p>“Pooh! I’m better than that! My heart is
in my own country and my—my— What is it
that’s on the other side of you from your heart,
brother?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Maybe gizzard.”</p>

<p>Carlota sat up, amazed and indignant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“Girls don’t have gizzards, Carlos Manuel.
Only chickens and geeses and things like those.
You haven’t paid attention when my father
teached you.”</p>

<p>Carlos laughed; so merrily and noisily that
old Marta came to the door of the adobe house
to see what was the fun. Nobody knew the
housekeeper’s real age, it was so very great.
None could remember things so far back as she,
but she had ceased to count the years long,
long ago, why not? What matter, if she still
had the heart of a child, yes?</p>

<p>Certainly, neither Carlos nor Carlota cared.
To them she had never changed, either in appearance
or kindness, and they found no birthdays
worth remembering except their own.
These only, probably, because of the gifts and
<i>fiestas</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> then made upon the whole rancho.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, I didn’t, little sister, but neither
did you, or you’d never have said ‘geeses’ nor
‘teached’.”</p>

<p>“Both of us was wrong, weren’t we?” returned
the girl, with as fine a disregard of grammar
as of ill temper. “We’ll be more ’tentive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
when our father comes home, won’t we? When
will that be, Carlos?”</p>

<p>It was a perplexing question, and the boy put
it aside, as he put all difficulties, until a more
convenient season. Crossing his arms above
his head, he gazed unblinkingly upward into the
brilliant sky, proposing:</p>

<p>“Let’s find things in the clouds, Carlota. I
see a ship, I do, truly. It’s just like the pictures
in the books. All its sails are set and flying.
Oh! can’t you see? Right there? There!
It’s moving northward fast—fast! It might be
the ship in which our father will come home.”</p>

<p>He meant to comfort her, but Carlota would
not look up. She could not. The sunbeams
made prisms of the teardrops on her lashes and
blinded her. She buried her face in the grass to
escape these tiny “rainbows,” and all at once
fell to sobbing bitterly.</p>

<p>Carlos hated that. He hated anything dark
or unhappy. He sat up and patted his sister’s
shoulder, soothingly, entreating:</p>

<p>“There, don’t! Don’t, girlie. Our father
wouldn’t like it if he should come home now,
this minute, and find you crying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>The words were magic. Carlota sprang to
her feet and earnestly peered into the distance,
crying:</p>

<p>“Is he? Do you see him, brother? Do
you?”</p>

<p>Carlos, also, leaped up and threw his arm
about her waist:</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that, did I? I only said ‘if.’”</p>

<p>“I don’t like ‘ifs,’” sobbed Carlota.</p>

<p>“Oh, Carlota, don’t cry. You shall not. If
you do I will go away myself, to the northwest,
to find my father.”</p>

<p>“Oh! let’s!”</p>

<p>“I said ‘I.’ Not you. Girls never go anywhere,
because they always cry. If it hadn’t
been for that my father might have taken me
with him. You see, he couldn’t take you, on account
of it; and he couldn’t leave you at home
with only Marta and the men, for then—that
would make more tears. So I had to stay to
take care of you, and I do think, if I were
a girl, the very first thing I would do—I
wouldn’t cry. Criers never have real good
times, I guess.”</p>

<p>This was logic, and from Carlos, whom Carlota
idolized only less than their absent father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
most convincing. She winked very fast and
drew her sleeve across her eyes, to dry the drops
which would not be shaken off.</p>

<p>“I—I won’t cry any more, brother; that is,
not where anybody can see me.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you manage not to do it at all. It’s
so dreadfully silly. It doesn’t bring father
back; does it?”</p>

<p>“No—o,” assented the other, with a catch
in her voice.</p>

<p>“Nor—Oh! brother! If you won’t, you
won’t, so that’s a dear, and don’t let’s talk any
more about it. One—two—three! Who is
first at the corral shall have first ride on
Benoni!”</p>

<p>Now, Carlos was an honorable boy, if a rather
lazy and pompous one, so he waited until his
sister had placed her feet exactly alongside his
own, on that convenient lime-line, before he repeated:</p>

<p>“One—two—three! Off!”</p>

<p>Like arrows they sped across the plain, past
the ancient adobe which was their home, and
again old Marta hobbled to its door to watch
the sturdy little figures, graceful as all other
wild, young creatures of that wide, free land.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Yet they looked more like children of some Indian
race, which disdained the dress of civilization,
than of white and cultured people.
Unshorn and bare headed, their yellow curls
floated backward over shoulders clad in kid-skin.
Each wore a costume of the same pattern, save
that Carlota’s tunic reached to her knees, while
her brother’s was cut short at the waist, where
a sash of crimson was loosely knotted. At the
ankles, their leather leggings were met by gaily
embroidered moccasins; and, indeed, their whole
garb was simple and comfortable, though exquisitely
fine and dainty, and had been designed
by their father to meet the needs of the peculiar
life they led.</p>

<p>“Together!” shouted Carlos, as they reached
their goal; and Carlota’s delight in thus equalling
her brother banished all lonely thoughts.
She did not suspect, nor he tell her, that her
twin had purposely shortened his steps to suit
her own. Instead, he proposed:</p>

<p>“Let’s ride him together! I heard Miguel
talking about a ‘shearing,’ this morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh! let’s!”</p>

<p>“Then run to Marta for a bit of luncheon
while I bridle Benoni. Tell her we may not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
home till nightfall, for father said we were never
to worry the dear old thing—so don’t forget
that, and be sure to bring a lot of her freshest
<i>bollos</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Carlota had already started, but paused astonished
to ask:</p>

<p>“Why, brother, does old Marta ever worry?
I didn’t know it. Worrying is what my father
does sometimes, isn’t it? When people come to
talk to him about their troubles?”</p>

<p>Carlos felt that any conversation with the
word “father” in it was to be avoided, so answered
indifferently:</p>

<p>“Oh! not really worry, you know. She
wouldn’t do that about me; nor about you, if I
were with you. And I s’pose I’m master of
the rancho when my father”—but there was
that word forcing itself in again, and the boy
hurried past it to add, convincingly: “A
master, a Don or a Señor, a gentleman, always
looks out for the comfort of all his old women
and little girls.”</p>

<p>They would never get the delectable <i>bollos</i> at
this rate! For the mood and manner which had
fallen upon her twin was so new to Carlota that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>she could only stand and stare at his swaggering
movements. Seeing this, he promptly assumed
his natural manner, which was not that of a
care-taker, and, springing to Benoni’s back laid
himself down along it while, clasping the
animal’s beautiful neck, he rode out of the corral.</p>

<p>Again standing at her doorway, old Marta
awaited the children’s approach, reflecting:</p>

<p>“Ah! little ones! So it is always. The easy
things of life fall to my Carlos, by right, is it
not? While to thee, <i>niña</i> the speeding feet of
my service, the burden and the care. But not
yet, heart of mine. Look not so at Marta with
thy great eyes. There shall be no care for thee,
beloved, while I live. What do I hear?
<i>Bollos?</i> Sweets? Not home till nightfall?
<i>Caramba!</i> With whom, then, shall I play when
all my tasks are done? <i>Si</i>,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I know. I will
take me my guitar and I will to myself sing,
why not. But to myself, <i>en verdad</i>,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> quite to
my own self.”</p>

<p>Now, this wise old dame knew that nothing
would more easily lure her charges home in good
season than this suggestion of songs and guitar.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>To hear old Marta sing, in her cracked and
toothless voice, was the funniest experience of
their gay young lives. It was rarely she could
be prevailed upon to so amuse them and Carlota
hesitated and called to Carlos:</p>

<p>“Brother, did you hear that? This is the
night when Marta sings. If we shouldn’t get
back in time! But—they will be shearing for
many days to come.”</p>

<p>“So will our Marta sing, at any hour, to
please her ‘heart’s dearest’!” retorted the
boy, laughing and sitting upright upon Benoni,
while he bowed so profoundly that he lost his
balance and slipped to the ground, at the old
woman’s feet.</p>

<p>“Woulds’t jeer at thy Marta, woulds’t thou?”
she demanded, and playfully cuffed him. Then,
laughing as merrily as they, she swung Carlota
up into her brother’s place, exclaiming: “’Tis
thou, soul of my life, shall ride ‘before’ this
day!”</p>

<p>She seized the loosened bridle just in time.
Another instant and Benoni would have been off
over the plain for a wild gallop with the now
rising wind. He, too, was young and full of caprice
as these other children—golden-haired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
and gray. None of the four knew any other
home than Refugio, that cluster of venerable
adobe buildings, nor much further restraint
than the needs of nature imposed.</p>

<p>To live always in the open, save when hunger
or drowsiness drove them indoors, to love all
men and fear none—such was their habit. As
yet, of things deeper than habit only Marta ever
thought, and she but seldom. Their moods
were their rulers and the present mood of the
twins was for a long holiday at the sheep-shearing,
a dozen miles away.</p>

<p>So, indulgent Marta brought out her finest
basket—of such exquisite workmanship that it
could be folded like a cloth, yet so tightly woven
it would hold water—and packed it with a
generous luncheon. Yet, as she finished her
task, she lifted her face and sniffed suspiciously,
saying:</p>

<p>“Ha! The wind rises faster. That is not
good. There may be a ‘norther.’ Best safe at
home, to-day, my children. To-morrow, <i>mañana</i>,
there will yet be the shearing.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Marta. Didn’t s’pose they could
finish it in one day, did you? This year there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
are more sheep than ever and my father—”</p>

<p>Carlos paused and glanced at his sister.
That day, it seemed as if he couldn’t open his
lips without mentioning that absent loved one,
which was natural enough. Their father was
the center of their existence, and for the first
time in their memories, he had been away for
many days; they had not yet learned to live
without him.</p>

<p>However, Carlota had not noticed anything
save that mention of the sheep-shearing and a
dreadful possibility had entered her mind concerning
it. Impatient to be away, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Never mind the wind, Marta, dear. It’s
delicious, for the sun is so hot. But if you fear
a ‘norther,’ just please give us our blankets
and sombreros and let us go. Do you know, I
haven’t seen—Santa Maria—this day!”</p>

<p>“Nor I, San Jose! Do you s’pose—would
they dare—just because our father is away—”</p>

<p>Whatever Carlota’s fear, Carlos now shared
it. He added his entreaties to hers and Marta
limped into the house after their little Navajo
blankets and sombreros, which they put between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
them upon Benoni’s back, while Carlos cried:</p>

<p>“Now we’re ready for anything that comes.
Don’t sing till we get home, dear Marta, and—
<i>Adios! Guay, Benoni! Vamos!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<small>UNEXPECTED GUESTS</small></h2>

<p>Before they had ridden far, Carlos, whom
Marta had laughingly compelled to take the
place behind his sister, reached over her
shoulder and laid his hand upon the bridle rein,
saying:</p>

<p>“Wait, Carlota. Turn him around. I want
to go to the schoolroom and get my <i>riata</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and
my little hammer.”</p>

<p>“Let’s! I’ll get my posy-box, too. Maybe
we’ll find some nice new things to show our
father—when he comes home,” she wistfully
answered.</p>

<p>“Of course!” assented the boy, wheeling
Benoni about, only to pull him up again in sheer
amazement.</p>

<p>Upon the plain before them was a group of
four persons, neither Indians, neighbors, nor any
white settlers whom the children knew, though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>the two burros were of the familiar type of
<i>vaqueros</i><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> employed upon their own rancho.
The other two strangers were mounted upon fine
horses and wore queer clothing, once white, but
now soiled and travel-stained. On their heads
were curious canvas helmets with green linings
and floating, gauzy veils. Also, these two men
carried monster umbrellas of white and green,
which strange articles nearly sent Benoni into
convulsions. He trembled like an aspen, and
his suffering promptly restored Carlota’s own
composure. She soothed him in her gentlest
accents:</p>

<p>“There, there, my darling! Whoa, my
pretty! Dearest beastie, don’t you fear, heart
of my life! Carlota will take care of Benoni.
So she will!”</p>

<p>Carlos could only sit and stare, his curiosity
increasing when the foremost rider of the group
burst into a hearty laugh of relief and amusement.
Then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“So, you two ferocious creatures are not
young Indians, after all! But pray tell me if
this is a land where the girls act as guides and
protectors to their brothers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>Neither child fully understood this speech,
yet Carlos perceived that, for the second
time that day, he was being ridiculed. First,
by old Marta, and now by this stranger. This
made him forget that cardinal virtue of instant
and unquestioning hospitality in which he had
been trained and to retort:</p>

<p>“If people do not like the land and its customs
they needn’t come into it, no! As for girls
‘protecting’—Pooh! Everywhere men who are
men are brave as they are tender and, my father
says, to be indulgent is not weakness, always.”</p>

<p>The stranger’s amusement had given place to
a frank admiration of the beautiful boy thus
arrogantly assuming manhood’s airs, even in
part deserving them. Also, the younger gentleman
courteously asked:</p>

<p>“Will you kindly tell me, little lady, if there
is water near at hand? We are all very
thirsty.”</p>

<p>“Surely. Right here in the schoolroom. It
is but a tiny way—. Only those queer things—Benoni—I’d
show you if it wasn’t for them.
I’ll show you, anyway. Here, Carlos!” and
with a swift, graceful movement the girl tossed
the bridle toward her brother and slipped to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the ground. Then lightly catching the bit-ring
of the questioner’s horse, she ran forward at a
pace which compelled the animal she led to
trot. “Right yonder, where the osiers grow, is
the most delicious spring of water in all New
Mexico. So my father thinks.”</p>

<p>Everybody now followed Carlota, even
Benoni; though he planted his forefeet firmly
every once in a while as if protesting against
the cruelty of his young master in thus forcing
him to keep so near those terrible umbrellas;
but, fortunately, by the time they reached the
spring these obnoxious things had been furled
and laid upon the ground.</p>

<p>“The basket, brother! The basket—hurry!”
cried the little girl, promptly emptying its
precious cakes upon the grass as he tossed
it to her. Then she filled it with water and
offered it to him who had first complained of
thirst.</p>

<p>“Thank you, little lady, but my father needs
it most. All the time he suffers from the heat
and dryness, and is always ready for a drink.
Though I doubt if he has ever used a cup so
odd and pretty.”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, but it isn’t a cup. It’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
basket. Old Marta made it. She can make
some even beautifuller.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? What a skillful Marta she must
be! This is the finest basket I ever saw.”
Then, receiving the utensil from his father’s
hand he dipped and offered it to the two Mexican
servants. Afterward he quenched his own
thirst, which must have been intense, for he
drank so deeply before he finished.</p>

<p>“There! I thought you were a gentleman, if
the other’s not,” remarked the observant Carlota,
with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Eh? Thank you, but I must claim that my
father is, also, a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Why then did he make Carlos get angry?”</p>

<p>“Maybe because he’s very tired and not used
to boys. Where is the schoolroom you mentioned?”</p>

<p>“Why—this. We’re in it, now.”</p>

<p>The young man whistled in surprise, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Well, truly, this is a remarkable country!
An out-of-door schoolroom. Is the sun your
teacher?”</p>

<p>“My father is our teacher. Course, he knows
everything there is, I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“What is his name? I like to know wise
people, though they are very scarce.”</p>

<p>“Adrian Manuel. My brother is Carlos and
I am Carlota Manuel. We are twins, though
he is so much bigger than me.”</p>

<p>Again the stranger whistled, then hastily
called to the older man who had lain down in
the shade of the osiers to cool and rest:</p>

<p>“Father! We’ve struck the very spot!”</p>

<p>That gentleman arose with surprising quickness,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>“What! Is this the Refugio Rancho?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Señor,” answered Carlos who had
shown the Mexicans a pool beyond the spring
where they could water their animals and who
now returned to stand beside his sister, with
his arm about her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Does your father live here, son?”</p>

<p>“Course.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? I have come a long, long distance
on purpose to see, and talk with him.
I’ve written him a score of letters without avail,
so now I’ll try what word of mouth will do,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
answered the elder gentleman, with considerable
sharpness.</p>

<p>“When he comes home he’ll be glad to talk
with you. He always likes to talk with
strangers and makes them welcome. I forgot
that when I lost my temper. I beg your pardon,
Señor.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, lad. But allow me to say
that, upon my word, you’re the queerest little
chap I ever met. Indian clothes, Spanish
graces, and Yankee bluntness. So this is
Refugio, at last! Hmm, hmm. Well, well,
well! Where is the house!”</p>

<p>“Yonder, Señor, among the palms and olives
that partly hide it. There is a rise of ground
that way, too. Would you like to go there
now?” asked Carlos, once more the courteous
small host his father would have approved.</p>

<p>“Presently, thank you. But I find this rest
and shade delightful. My! It’s a hot country!
Sit down on the grass here and tell me all you
know about Refugio.”</p>

<p>Both children laughed aloud at that, Carlos
replying:</p>

<p>“It would take till nightfall! Why, I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
talk about our dear Refugio ‘forever and a day’
and not have done. You see, Señor, it’s such
a very old place. My father says it is one of
the most ancient landmarks. A landmark is, if
you don’t know—I didn’t—one of the boundaries
of a country or its history. Old Refugio
is both.”</p>

<p>The boy was as eager to discuss this beloved
subject as the newcomers were to listen, but
Carlota quietly interposed:</p>

<p>“If brother once begins to talk about Refugio
and the things which have happened here he
won’t know how to stop. Yet my father says
that travelers are always hungry when they get
here, we live so far from any other rancho. So,
if you won’t go to the house yet, will you have
some of our cakes here?”</p>

<p>Gathering up the cakes and loaves she had
emptied from the basket, she proffered them to
the strangers, beginning with the gray haired
man as she had seen his son do with the water.</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you. Though it’s not long since
we stopped to eat, those cakes smell very appetizing.
Let us all sit about the spring and
enjoy them together. So, this is your schoolroom.
What do you learn in it?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“I could better tell you what we don’t. First,
there’s geography. See that white line?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It suggests a tennis-court. What is
it for?”</p>

<p>Carlos sprang up and merrily bestrode the
line-mark, crying:</p>

<p>“One leg is in my native land and one upon
foreign soil! That’s the way my father says
it. This—” putting his hand upon a tuft of
grass—“is in Mexico. This other in the
United States. Our rancho is the southeast
boundary of our own country. Our house was
built hundreds of years ago by the good priests
who came to teach the Pueblos about our Lord.
That’s why they named it Refugio, the House of
Refuge. Because it wasn’t only to help folks
to go to Heaven, it was to give them shelter
when they were persecuted. Somebody must
always have been fighting then, I think.”</p>

<p>“So history says. Do you learn that, too?”
inquired the younger gentleman.</p>

<p>“Yes. Not out of books, though. Father
says we’re to study that way, later. Now, he
just brings out old Guadalupo—who’s a hundred
and fifteen years—and, sometimes, Marta,
and makes them what he calls his ‘texts.’ He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
says that they’re living history. Carlota and I
are history-makers, too. If we should live as
long as those old folks somebody might find us
just as interesting as we do them.”</p>

<p>“Far more so, maybe. I find you extremely
interesting even now. I would like to hear a
great deal about your lives and doings.”</p>

<p>Carlos thoughtfully studied the young gentleman’s
face, then asked:</p>

<p>“Would you, really? How strange that
seems—just children like us. Let me see. We
learn Spanish and behavior—when we don’t
forget it—from the Mestizas. They are never,
never rude. Even when they stab a man in
the back they do it courteously. So Miguel
says.”</p>

<p>“What? What! You dreadful child! Are
you taught stabbing, also, in this modern school
of philosophy?” demanded the elder Mr. Disbrow,
nervously glancing toward his dark-skinned
servants.</p>

<p>Carlos rolled upon the grass, boisterously
laughing. Then, suddenly remembering the
“courtesy” which he boasted of having studied,
sat up and apologized.</p>

<p>The apology accepted, the inquiry followed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“Do you like to speak the Spanish you are
taught?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I love it! You can say such things in
it. They seem to mean more, ’specially if
you’re angry. But our father doesn’t wish us
to use it very much. He says we must first acquire
pure English. He is very particular himself.
But isn’t it hard to be grammar-y?”
asked Carlota, not to be left out of the conversation.</p>

<p>“Very. Yet, I think your father couldn’t
have greatly objected to the Spanish, since he
gave you such pretty Spanish names,” answered
Mr. Rupert.</p>

<p>“That was our mother’s doing. She named
us. See? That is where she sleeps. That is
her grave.”</p>

<p>The little girl stood up and pointed to a clump
of agave plants, in the midst of which rose a
flower-decked mound, with a simply-inscribed,
natural boulder at its head.</p>

<p>After a hasty exchange of glances, with one
impulse, the strangers rose and quietly walked
to the spot Carlota had designated. For a little
time they stood there, with bowed heads, as if
doing reverence to the slumbering dust below,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
then gravely turned away. They did not again
sit down in the “schoolroom” and, immediately,
Mr. Rupert asked the children to guide them to
the house.</p>

<p>For the first time in their lives the twins regarded
their mother’s resting place with feelings
of awe, inspired by the solemn manner of
these strangers. She had died when they were
babies, but their father had kept alive in their
hearts a consciousness of her existence as real
as it was joyous.</p>

<p>Their happy mother, young, beloved, and
beautiful; who had sung and laughed her way
through life, and who had trustfully gone out of
it to another which was even fuller of sunshine.
Why should anybody grow stern and sad who
looked down upon her grave?</p>

<p>They could not fathom the mystery, and
soberly led the way to the old adobe Mission,
which had been a House of Refuge for so many
strangers.</p>

<p>“I think, Carlota, maybe these are the
‘enemy’ sort of folks Miguel so often talks
about, and seems to expect will come, sometime
to Refugio,” impressively whispered
Carlos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“‘Enemies’ are wicked people, isn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es. I be-lieve so;” yet the boy’s tone
was doubtful. If these were “enemies” they
appeared to be more queer than wicked.</p>

<p>“Hmm. Then that is why.”</p>

<p>“Why what, girlie?”</p>

<p>“Why they wear such funny hats on their
heads and carry such strange things in their
hands. Don’t you remember that in all the
stories of bad ones there’s always something to
know them by? Marks on their foreheads, or
ugly clothes or faces; and now those have—I
wonder what they call these horrid greeny-white
open-and-shutters that scared Benoni so!
You see, brother, he knew they were ‘enemies’
at once. Horses do know lots about such
things, Marta says.”</p>

<p>“They are ‘sunumberellas.’ I asked the
gentleman,” answered Carlos, proud of this acquisition
to his “pure English.”</p>

<p>“Then whenever I see a ‘sunerbell’ I shall
know I see an ‘enemy,’ too,” rejoined Carlota,
with conviction.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>REFUGIO</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Nobody living knew how old the House of
Refuge was.</p>

<p>Guadalupo, who seemed as native to the soil
as the cacti at its gates, affirmed that it did not
“grow any older.” He had been born there
and he had found it “just so.” It had never
changed.</p>

<p>It was an abandoned Franciscan Mission,
with chapel and cloister and bell-tower. Within
that square, corner belfry still hung the curious
bells, each with a rude, jangling clapper
between its iron discs. Tradition said that
these quaint bells were rung by the ancient
Padres not only to summon their neophytes to
religious services but, also, to their meals; and
this hospitable custom was still followed by
Adrian Manuel, into whose possession as a
private residence the Mission had now come.</p>

<p>Early in his occupation he had carefully restored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
the half-obliterated Spanish text over
the refectory door: “It is the House of Refuge.
Enter and be glad, all ye who will.”
Thereafter, so far as lay within his power, the
new master of old Refugio made that legend
the rule of his own household.</p>

<p>So when old Marta saw the children returning
so soon, accompanied by strangers, she set
the fire ablaze and, at once, prepared a pot of
her delicious coffee. When, putting a loaf and
a knife upon the oaken table, she repaired to the
doorway and, with many obeisances, awaited the
party’s approach.</p>

<p>The sight of her banished all perplexities
from Carlota’s mind, and she ran forward to
take her own rightful place at the housekeeper’s
side; for, as her beloved father often
told her, was she not the little mistress of his
home? Thence she announced with her best
manner:</p>

<p>“Welcome, friends. We are very happy to
see you at Refugio.” Yet she whispered to old
Marta: “Brother and I think that these people
are ‘enemies,’ but then they’re guests, too.
They have come to see my father.”</p>

<p>The strangers politely returned the child’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
salutation and again the elder Mr. Disbrow exclaimed:
“So, this is Refugio!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Señor—Mister Stranger, and I hope
you will like it,” answered Carlota.</p>

<p>The younger gentleman now made a formal
presentation:</p>

<p>“This is Mr. George Disbrow, my father;
and I am Rupert, his son. Maybe you have
heard of us, Miss Carlota.”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Rupert, never. Did you ever see
our father?”</p>

<p>“I have not, but my father knew him very
well.”</p>

<p>“How delightful! Isn’t he— Didn’t you love
him dearly?” she eagerly demanded of the elder
man.</p>

<p>“Hmm. I can’t say that there was any affection
between us.”</p>

<p>At this reply Carlota drew back, chilled; but
Mr. Rupert immediately began to speak of her
beautiful home and its curiosities and for her,
as for Carlos, there was no theme more beloved.</p>

<p>Forgetting her annoyance she hastily began to
lead her guest about the ancient buildings, descanting
upon every object they passed with
such eagerness that she thereby greatly confused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
his ideas concerning them. So that he
pleaded:</p>

<p>“Slowly, little lady, please. It’s all so wonderful
to me I want to take it carefully. This
was the refectory, you say. Do you still use
it for a dining hall?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh! yes. And, sometimes, after the
shearing and such things when we have everybody
here to a <i>fiesta</i>, it is just full of people.
Oh! I love it then! and so does my father.
But—now shut your eyes! Please shut them
just a minute and don’t open them till I tell you,
and I’ll show you the ‘loveliest spot on earth,’
my father says.”</p>

<p>Her enthusiasm won his compliance with her
whim and, like a boy at play, he followed her
blindfold down many passages and through the
breezy cloister, till she paused and cried:
“Now, look! Quick!”</p>

<p>Then he raised his lids but promptly dropped
them again, to clear his bewildered vision.</p>

<p>“Oh! Señor, isn’t it beautiful?”</p>

<p>“Beautiful, indeed! It is a miracle! It is
a paradise!”</p>

<p>“Oh! no. It is my mother’s garden,” said
Carlota, simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“But your mother is dead, long ago,” responded
Mr. Rupert, in surprise.</p>

<p>“She has only gone to Heaven. Father and
I are taking care of it for her. He does all
the heavy work, because the water-cans are too
big for me, though we have a fine little water-wagon
that we roll around from place to place.
But I, myself, prune and cut every plant that
needs it. They are from almost all the
countries in the world, and some of them have
cost my father much, much money. Many have
cost nothing but a nice ride or tramp after
them. All the things my mother put here, herself,
are still alive. Nothing can help living
because we so love everything that grows; and,
besides, the climate is perfect, my father says,”
finished the little girl.</p>

<p>Truly it was a wonderful place, this old court
of the monastery. Its southern, open side was
a hedge of the prickly pear, which the wise
Franciscans had found a natural and safe barricade
against the troublous Indians. This hedge
was much taller than Carlota’s head and was
more than eight feet in width. Its lower
branches were curiously gnarled and twisted
and as thick as a man’s arm, while every portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
bristled with strong spines more difficult
to force than bayonet-points, they were so
closely interwoven and needle-sharp. Mr. Rupert
would have tarried long before this ancient
hedge, but his small guide would not so allow.</p>

<p>“See those palms and olives? They are as
old as old! Like Refugio itself. But the roses
yonder came from France only this last year.
And right here—look! These are anemones
from my mother’s own childhood’s home. She
had them sent after her when she came here.”</p>

<p>“And living still!”</p>

<p>“Surely. Do you s’pose we’d ever let them
die? God had to have her in His Heaven, but
He left us her garden. My father—”</p>

<p>“Your ‘father’ is your idol, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“My idol? Father? How queer!” The
idea was so amusing that the child clapped her
hands and laughed aloud. She had been used
to hearing the literal truth and “idols” suggested
something most grotesque. Cried she:
“Come! I’ll show you. We have a lot, from
the Pueblos, and Old Mexico, and everywhere.
There is a room just for them, the ugly, hideous
things!”</p>

<p>She made him look at them every one. Cheap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
little images of red clay, or stone, with some
that were more pretentious; and as he examined
them his astonishment continually grew. Not
at the curious carving, for the “collection” was
not extensive, but at the characteristics of this
unknown Adrian Manuel, whom he had heard
described as “beneath contempt.”</p>

<p>However, his reflections were cut short, not
only by Carlota’s eagerness to show him more
of the Mission but by the entrance of a man who
might be either a “cow boy” or a Mexican
brigand, to judge from his appearance.</p>

<p>And now, for the first time in her life, Carlota
heard Miguel Cardanza speak otherwise than
courteously to a guest. He brusquely asked:</p>

<p>“Señor, will you tell me your business here?”</p>

<p>Mr. Rupert showed a brief surprise, then
quietly answered:</p>

<p>“I accompany my father, Mr. George Disbrow,
upon an unfamiliar journey to accomplish
a certain task. I will leave him to explain what
that is. Are you Adrian Manuel?”</p>

<p>“His trusted friend and <i>major-domo</i>,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Miguel Cardanza, at your service;” but the
haughty salutation which accompanied these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
words evinced that such “service” would be
grudgingly performed.</p>

<p>“When will your master return?”</p>

<p>“Señor, at his own good pleasure.”</p>

<p>“We will, I presume, await that season,
trusting it will not long be postponed.”</p>

<p>“That is as may be. But I must, on his behalf,
request you to leave Refugio immediately.
Yes, yes, little one. I know you marvel to hear
such rudeness from your Miguel’s lips. Yet I
am right, yes. I know what I do. Well,
Señor?”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Cardanza, I protest. Though he
might not care to receive us I doubt if even
your master would turn us adrift in this
sparsely settled land. We have traveled many
miles since daybreak, yet this is the first shelter
we have seen.”</p>

<p>“Señor, you traveled in the wrong direction,
that is all. There are settlements in plenty.
That way, thus—” pointing toward the northeast—“lives
a man who takes in pilgrims for
a price. He is a hungry miner, and an hour’s
ride will bring you to his shack. It is the only
inn this side Lanark.”</p>

<p>Carlota had been a silent listener to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
dialogue but she now interrupted it with:</p>

<p>“Miguel, you shall not send any weary man
away. Even if he were—were the evil one, this
was once God’s House, and it is still Refugio.
Miguel Cardanza, I shall tell my father about
you when he comes home. Oh! if he came now!
What would he say to you but: ‘Good Miguel,
hot-headed as ever?’ Oh! I know. I’ve heard
him, often, often. Do be a nice old Miguel,
do—”</p>

<p>The Spaniard flushed but caught the child’s
hand and whispered in her ear. She listened
with impatience, amazement, and, at last, with
wild alarm. Then, darting one terrified glance
toward the unfortunate Mr. Rupert, vanished
from the cloister, shrieking, as she ran:</p>

<p>“Carlos! Carlos! Brother! My brother!
For our father’s sake come—come quick—quick!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>WHAT SERVES, SERVES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Miguel was the trusted and capable manager
of Refugio Rancho, and, also, he knew something
of its owner’s private affairs. What he
did not know he surmised and not always correctly.
He knew that Mrs. Manuel, an
orphan, had married against the will of the
wealthy eccentric aunt who had reared her;
and that this old Mrs. Sinclair had never forgiven
Adrian Manuel for his share in the affair,
and had harshly accused him of seeking her
money as well as her niece, whom she promptly
disinherited.</p>

<p>Then, after the death of the young wife, she
suddenly demanded possession of “her Mary’s
children;” alleging that their father was unfit
to “raise them in the wilderness.” This demand
had been made in her name by her
lawyers, Disbrow and Disbrow. Upon condition
of Mr. Manuel’s absolutely resigning them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
to her she promised to educate them well and
to bequeath them her fortune. Originally, the
lonely old lady had asked for the children from
a real desire for their affection, hoping they
would fill the place in her life left empty by
their mother’s desertion; but when the father
positively and courteously declined her offers
on their behalf, her strong and wilful temper
had been aroused and she determined to have
them at all costs.</p>

<p>It had therefore developed into a mere contest
of wills. The lawyers’ letters grew more
frequent and importunate as the years passed
and, finally, she had induced the Disbrows to
undertake a personal visit to Refugio in the
hope of thus effecting what the numberless
letters had failed to do.</p>

<p>Mr. Manuel’s plans for his idolized children
were simple and decided, and though not a
wealthy man, he possessed sufficient fortune to
carry them out. He intended to educate them
himself up to a certain degree; then, leaving
Refugio in Miguel’s hands, go north with them,
place them in some good co-educational college,
and himself settle near them till their four
years’ course of study should be completed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>But, of late, something had happened to make
these plans doubtful. He had not confided this
doubt to Miguel, but had gone quietly away for
a time until the doubt could be settled. He did
not explain what this uncertainty was. He
merely departed, leaving a sealed letter of instructions
in his steward’s hands. If at the
end of two months he had not returned this
letter was to be opened and its instructions implicitly
followed. Meanwhile:</p>

<p>“You are master of Refugio while I am gone,
good Miguel. And more than that you are absolute
guardian of my precious children till I
come and claim them from you. See to it, on
your love and honor, that no harm befalls them;
else, look to welcome home a broken-hearted
man.”</p>

<p>These had been Adrian Manuel’s last words
to his manager, as he departed on a journey
more hazardous than anybody guessed, and
Miguel had treasured them in his inmost heart.</p>

<p>Now his fealty and his honor were to be
tested. Instantly, upon learning who the
strangers were and realizing that they had
chosen the time of his master’s absence to
arrive, he leaped to the conclusion that they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
come to carry by force what persuasion had
failed to accomplish. In brief: they had come
to kidnap the twins!</p>

<p>It was this belief which had inspired his rudeness
to Mr. Rupert and this fear which had been
whispered to little Carlota. He had bidden
her seek Carlos and go with him to some safe
place of hiding until such time as the strangers
should grow weary of their fruitless efforts and
depart. There were many, many outbuildings
at Refugio. It was, indeed, as strangers always
said, large enough for a regular rancheria, or
village, and had been such in the old Padres’
time. In some one of these many old adobes
the imperilled little ones might stay till danger
was past, and in whichever spot they hid he
would soon find and watch over them. The
main thing was for them to disappear, and at
once. Alas! hasty Miguel little dreamed how
literally they were to obey his commands!</p>

<p>It was but a few moments after the manager
had whispered his caution that old Marta
paused in her supper getting, and its incident
scolding of young Anita, her helper, to watch
the children speed past her kitchen door, and
remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“There they flit, yes, the children of my last
days. Heart of my life, but it was fine to hear
that small Carlota speak the strange Señor
so fair. Anita, under her curls of gold lie the
brains thou lackest, my imbecile!”</p>

<p>“Then if she has what belongs to me, let her
restore to me my own, for her then, the indolent,
would be thy unnumbered chidings. Good.
‘Turn about is fair play.’ Why should she always
be free to run and ride while I—”</p>

<p>“Take that for thy insolence, kitchen-maid!
Let me tell thee that in that far land whence my
child’s blessed mother came, the Señora Manuel
of holy memory, there are—Bah! Why waste
words on such? <i>This</i> is for the impudence; and
<i>this</i>—because thou mindest not the <i>podrida</i><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
but must be staring, staring at every stranger-man
crossing the threshold of Refugio!”</p>

<p>The housekeeper’s words were emphasized by
a couple of heavy slaps upon Anita’s broad
shoulders, but the girl cared no more for the
blows than for the interminable scoldings. It
was all in the day’s work, yes. She, too, loved
her master’s children, as everybody knew, and
having annoyed Marta by her pretended envy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
of Carlota the mischievous maid was ready to
join the old woman at the door and behold what
thence might be seen.</p>

<p>There was always something interesting.
Miguel pottering about, swaggering in that
authority he never allowed to lapse; a <i>vaquero</i>
coming or going; now and again, a farm hand,
with Mateo, the gardener; and “forever and
always,” the poultry-boys, chasing the fowls
from the cistern.</p>

<p>Anita was just in time to see the twins swing
themselves upon Benoni’s back, where their
Navajo blankets still rested. They had put on
their sombreros and now, seeing the two
women in the doorway, Carlos caught his off
and waved it as he cried:</p>

<p>“<i>Adios!</i> Marta—Anita—Refugio! <i>Adios—ADIOS!</i>”</p>

<p>What was there in that familiar salutation
that set old Marta’s heart to beating trip-hammer
strokes? Clapping her withered hand to
her side she caught hold of Anita and whirled
that young person around with an unexpected
force, demanding:</p>

<p>“Did’st thou hear that, yes? Why do they
say that? What is it?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_048">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_048.jpg" alt="“ADIOS, ADIOS!”">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“ADIOS, ADIOS!”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Leave hand! May I not hearken the last
word of the little one but I must be sent to mind
an old stew-pot of <i>podrida</i>?”</p>

<p>“<i>Podrida</i>—Pstit! Tell me. There’s something
amiss with my children, is it not? ‘<i>Adios</i>’—‘farewell’—It
has been often in that voice
of silver, but always with the sound of ‘I return,’
so sweet to hear. Always with the
laughter breaking through, but this time—the
heart-break!”</p>

<p>Feeling her own superstitious heart sing before
that strange expression on Marta’s paling
face, Anita indignantly retorted:</p>

<p>“You are a fanciful old woman. You are
dotard. What? Have you an ague, you?
Speak. Have you never seen the small ones
ride away upon Benoni that you should stare at
ghosts this hour?”</p>

<p>“Ghosts? Yes. I dreamed of their mother
last night. She was not weeping and wringing
her white hands, no? Anita Pichardo, I tell
thee that evil has come to Refugio this day,
and it is the strangers who have brought it.”</p>

<p>She paused and pointed toward Mr. Rupert,
hastily coming down the cloistered walk.</p>

<p>“Well then, Mother Marta, it is I, Anita, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
thanks this unknown evil for coming by so handsome
a carrier, yes. In truth, if it is this fine
Señor I am to serve at supper I will even bother
to stir the stew once more. Then I will put
on my Sunday gown, why not? Many strangers
have come to Refugio, but none so comely
as yon.”</p>

<p>Being something of a beauty and more of a
coquette, maid Anita chose the roundabout way
to her own chamber, along the veranda floor
and through the cloister, casting arch glances
toward the young lawyer who met her midway
the passage, but noticed her not at all.</p>

<p>Yet her trouble was not useless for, at the
turn of the corridor, she came upon Miguel and
one of the Mexicans who had arrived in the
Disbrows’ company. They were talking in
Spanish and Anita did not scruple to pause and
hearken; and what she overheard worked the
customary mischief of all half-truths, and she
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Santa Maria! It is so, then. Old Marta
was right! They knew, those small ones, my
heart’s delights! and they have run away! Yes,
yes, I understand! It was ‘<i>Adios</i>,’ indeed.
But—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Her coquetry now forgotten, Anita hurried
back to the kitchen by the shortest route; and,
muttering something which Marta did not comprehend,
caught off the pot of stew from its
hook in the fireplace. Hastily emptying the
mess into a handled jar, she seized a loaf from
the table and rushed away. The whole transaction
had so amazed the housekeeper that she
was speechless till, as the flutter of the maid’s
scarlet petticoat waved defiance from the dooryard,
her voice returned:</p>

<p>“Anita! AN-I-TA! Eyes of my soul, is
she daft, that one? <i>An—i—ta!</i> AN—I—I—TA!”</p>

<p>“Fortune favors the daring.” Miguel’s
horse Amador stood tethered near; for, when a
chance passer-by had reported meeting strangers
presumably bound for Refugio, the manager
had left the shearing-place and hurried
homeward, to find there the most unwelcome
guests who had ever sought its shelter.</p>

<p>“<i>Hola!</i> Amador! That is good, yes. This
jar grows heavy, and thy feet are swifter than
mine!” cried Anita, and mounted. So daringly
up and away—on Miguel’s own Amador which
none but he must ride!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“They have all gone mad!” shrieked Marta,
while Miguel entered the kitchen and indignantly
demanded:</p>

<p>“Mother, what ails the women? First the
little Carlota; I but whisper to her that which
she should know and off she flies, screaming,
louder than I dreamed she could. Then comes
Anita where she had no business, listens what
concerns her not, and off she races, likewise
screaming. Now thou—if—what?”</p>

<p>“The <i>podrida</i>—the supper, heart’s idol!”
wailed the housekeeper, and her sorely tried
son burst into a laugh, which she arrested by
a gesture and the words:</p>

<p>“‘He laughs best who laughs last,’ and that
won’t be my Miguel, no. For the guests of the
master to lose their supper, that is one thing,
indeed; but what of Amador, no?”</p>

<p>Now Amador was the delight of Miguel’s soul
and it needed but this suggestion to send him
doorward again. The horse was gone, and in
fury he turned upon his unoffending mother:</p>

<p>“Didst thou—didst—”</p>

<p>“Pouf! Is it I, Marta Cardanza, at eighty
years, would mount that fiend, Amador, and
ride away with a dangling jar of hot stew, yes?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Such pranks suit not gray hairs, Miguel, son of
my soul, no.”</p>

<p>“But which way, mother? How dared she?”
Marta shrugged her shoulders, answering:</p>

<p>“Bah! Some maids are ever silly. ’Tis I
think these strangers have foul-bewitched all
Refugio, yes.”</p>

<p>Yet there was a gleam of mischief in her
black eyes as she pointed to where a vaquero
was leading the beautiful horse that Mr. Rupert
had ridden to the rancho. “Tit for tat,” she
quoted in her native tongue.</p>

<p>“Thanks, mother! That is good!”</p>

<p>Then, even while Mr. Rupert came onward to
mount, did Miguel seize the creature before its
owner’s eyes and ride away as only a plainsman
can ride. Instantly, the visitor turned
upon his servant, like all the others—angry
with the wrong person:</p>

<p>“Boy, what do you mean by that? Where
has he gone?”</p>

<p>“How can I tell, Señor?”</p>

<p>“Why did you let him take the horse?”</p>

<p>“You had not so forbidden, Señor.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I told you to bring him here—for
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Ten thousand pardons, Señor. To bring
him here, yes. For whom—that was not mentioned.”</p>

<p>There was no virtue in anger, so Rupert Disbrow
forced a laugh; then looked up to find the
youthful eyes of wrinkled Marta watching him
with a keen amusement which plainly explained
the affair. Crossing to where she leaned
against the doorframe he lifted his helmet and
asked:</p>

<p>“Madam, may I have a word with you?”</p>

<p>“Many, if it so pleases the Señor.”</p>

<p>He looked past her into the great kitchen,
through which a swiftly rising breeze swept refreshingly,
and remarked:</p>

<p>“It feels like a storm. Do they often visit
this locality?”</p>

<p>“When the good God wills,” responded the
old woman, piously.</p>

<p>After all, she could see but little amiss with
this stranger. He had a speech and manner
which reminded her of her beloved, lost Doña
Mary, though she knew that he could not be of
that young mistress’s kin.</p>

<p>He presently observed, insinuatingly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“That settle against the window, yonder,
looks inviting.”</p>

<p>“The veranda is cooler, yes.”</p>

<p>“Then, by all means, let us sit there.”</p>

<p>He certainly was courteous. No gentleman
of old Castile could have been more deferential.
He was fully equal in graciousness to Señor
Adrian, himself; and, after all—the <i>podrida</i>
was gone! That charge the saints had taken
off an old woman’s hands, yes. If there was
no supper—Pouf! there was still bread in the
buttery and fruit in plenty. With the master
at home, there would have been fowls to kill
and cook; yet—for this fair-speaking stranger?
Of that Marta was not so sure; any more than
she was sure of her regret for the lost <i>podrida</i>.
In any case, she now willingly took the place
upon the settle which the young man had earlier
indicated.</p>

<p>“Have you lived here always, Madam?” he
began.</p>

<p>“Always, Señor.”</p>

<p>“Then you must have known Mrs. Manuel.”</p>

<p>“As my own soul, yes.”</p>

<p>“Was she a happy woman?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“The angels in Paradise cannot be happier.”</p>

<p>“Yet she relinquished a great deal to come
here with her husband, nor had she known him
long.”</p>

<p>“A day is a lifetime when it is soul of one’s
soul,” answered Marta, now looking steadily
into his inquiring eyes with such an expression
that he abruptly terminated his cross-examination.</p>

<p>Returning to the present and his own perplexities
he said:</p>

<p>“That man who rode off upon my horse
seems to be a sort of ‘boss’ here, in Mr. Manuel’s
absence.”</p>

<p>“In truth, yes.”</p>

<p>“He declines the hospitality of Refugio to us,
but my father is an old man.”</p>

<p>“He should be thinking of his sins,” suggested
Marta.</p>

<p>“I can sleep out of doors, well enough, but he
can’t. Besides, he is saddle-worn and can ride
no further at present. What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“I was never good at riddles, no. My head,
it is quite stupid, yes.”</p>

<p>“But you are a woman. You should be merciful,
and Refugio means ‘succor.’ Remember,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
please, he is old and he—knew your mistress.”</p>

<p>She turned upon him sharply:</p>

<p>“But I remember, also, that he has come to
bring sorrow to her innocent little ones, yes.”</p>

<p>“No! I tell you truly that you are wholly
mistaken. Our errand is one of kindness, only.
Provide us shelter for to-night and to-morrow
I—”</p>

<p>She interrupted him by rising and saying:</p>

<p>“One may do what one will with one’s own,
is it not? It is the House of Refuge. Bring
the father. He is, indeed, too old for such a
task as his; but there is still time. He may
repent and depart before harm is done. I repeat,
it is the House of Refuge, and the sin of
turning any beggar from its doors shall lie
neither on the head of my beloved master nor
on that of Marta Cardanza. There are rooms
of my own, yes. In them—‘the house is
yours.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>A LITTLE EXCURSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<i>Basta</i>, enough! If some go supperless to
bed this night it shall not be the little ones!
<i>Vamos</i>, Amador!” cried Anita, as she struggled
to keep both her difficult seat and the contents
of the jar.</p>

<p>Now Amador was a horse of spirit, and, like
his master, was called a “woman hater”; therefore,
he resented the petticoat flapping against
his side. Rearing, he pawed the air with his
forefeet, tossed himself from side to side, and
vigorously tried to shake off the obnoxious
skirt.</p>

<p>“So? Wouldst thou? Vicious, like thy
owner, <i>si</i>? Well, learn then! One day is as
good as another to break thy will, and before
thou wast born, imp, Anita was a horsewoman.
Take that!”</p>

<p>With an audacity even Miguel would not have
shown, the excited girl brought the hot and
heavy jar down upon Amador’s shoulder, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
instantly, he stood stock-still, save for a peculiar
shivering through all his frame which, in
itself, would have warned Miguel of evil to
come.</p>

<p>Not inexperienced Anita. Her heart swelled
with pride and mischief, as she jeered:</p>

<p>“Ha, ungallant! Thus easily subdued by a
woman—<i>a woman</i>, Amador—Wouldst not the
skirt? Then, take this for thy incivility and—forward!”</p>

<p>Unwisely, she again lifted the jar and dealt
the beast a second blow, and, already loosened
by the violent shaking, the stopper fell out and
the warm contents splashed over his neck.</p>

<p>This was the last indignity which Amador
could endure. With a spring he was off. The
jar fell to the ground, broken, and for her life
Anita now clung to the bridle. But he thrust
his nostrils forward and jerked the reins from
her grasp. Then she gripped him about the
throat, half-choking him; yet the fire of his
wild ancestors stirred within him and he did
not stop for this. His wicked eyes glanced
backward and seemed to ask:</p>

<p>“Wouldst ride, Anita? Then ride thou shalt
till thou art content!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>She never knew how long that startling onrush
lasted. It seemed an endless progress in
which, each moment, destruction menaced her;
then, suddenly, she found herself in the middle
of a mesquite bush, her clothing torn, her face
scratched and bleeding, while the footfalls of
the now free Amador swiftly died in the distance.</p>

<p>“Ha! But you shall suffer—suffer—villain!”
she cried, as soon as she could recover
her breath. Then she tried to turn about, but
each movement meant agony. Everywhere the
sharp thorns of the shrub pierced her. To remain
was impossible—to extricate herself—Ugh!</p>

<p>When, at last, she stood free upon the ground
there was little in her appearance to recall the
coquettish Anita. Yet, at that moment, a ringing
laugh and mocking voice smote her ears:</p>

<p>“So? But you are well punished for your
impudence, fair mistress of the pans, is it
not? My Amador is a horse of sense. I knew
it!”</p>

<p>It was Miguel, who had urged Rupert Disbrow’s
“Lady Jane” to its utmost speed and
had arrived in time to witness the maid’s exit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
from the mesquite spines, though not to aid her.
Now, seeing that she was really suffering, he
dismounted and added:</p>

<p>“But, in truth! I am sorry! That was a
nasty trick of Amador—and I had esteemed
him a gentleman!”</p>

<p>Anita shrugged her torn shoulders, then
groaned:</p>

<p>“There are no gentlemen left at Refugio, no!
Since the Señor—my master was kind—he
would not jeer—”</p>

<p>Her voice died in a wail and Miguel exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why, child, Anita! Hush, hush! There,
there! So, so, my beauty!”</p>

<p>“Pstit! I am not a horse—not Amador—to
be soothed as a baby. He is—he is <i>diablo</i>!
and thou—his master!” she retorted. Then
dropped her scarred face in her hands and
again began to weep.</p>

<p>Miguel hated tears worse than he hated
women; and he laid his hand upon her arm,
asking:</p>

<p>“Why not believe that I am truly sorry?
And, in the name of reason, why stole you the
stew-pot as well as the horse?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“Why? For my children, souls of my life,
indeed, yes.”</p>

<p>“If they so choose, can they not eat their
meat in their father’s house?”</p>

<p>“Miguel Cardanza! Standest thou there
and askest me that?” tragically demanded the
maid.</p>

<p>In spite of his best intentions, Miguel
laughed. Poor Anita would also have laughed
if she could have seen herself; and her anger
slowly oozed away before his mirth. If he were
in that cheerful mood affairs could not be so
bad as she had fancied from what she had overheard
in the cloister. She determined to learn
the real truth now, and asked:</p>

<p>“Miguel Cardanza, did you not say that these
strangers had come to carry away our children?
Did you not forbid their man to help them in
their fiendish task? Oh! I heard you, I heard
you. And if the master’s ‘friend’ cares not
whither he sent the frightened innocents, Anita,
the humble kitchen-maid, has a heart of flesh
and will follow to care for them. Even I,
bruised by that vile Amador— Where are my
children, Miguel Cardanza?”</p>

<p>“Listen, Anita! If you shed more tears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
your face will be clean! If I sent the small
ones away it was but for a moment, till I could
speak to them more fully. Carlota is an angel.
She knew not till I whispered her, that the hand
she grasped so friendly had come to do her
harm. Bah! girl! Your eavesdropping has
wrought mischief this day!”</p>

<p>As their tempers cooled they had resumed
their ordinary speech, changing the “thou” to
“you”; and now, also, the manager realized
that he had acted foolishly and might have
chosen a better way to protect his charges. He
was vexed with Anita for putting such stress
upon the children’s disappearance. Of course,
they were safe somewhere near. What harm
could possibly come to them except from the
intriguing guests? It is natural to visit one’s
own fault upon somebody else and the maid afforded
the readiest victim of Miguel’s self-reproach.</p>

<p>“I tell you, silly wench, you have wrought
dire mischief. What is a mess of <i>podrida</i> to
our children when the whole countryside is
‘sanctuary’ for them. Are they not the little
ones of the ‘Lady of Refugio’? Is her name
not still a talisman? You should not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
scared them, you! Nor lost me my priceless
Amador—You—”</p>

<p>“I? I—scare them? I, Miguel Cardanza,
when I spoke not with them at all? You are
mad, I tell you. Everybody is mad this day,
and as for that fiend Amador, may he never
return!” exclaimed the amazed and indignant
damsel. Then drawing away from him, as he
continued to help her pull the thorns from her
dress, she added: “No! aid me no more.
Your courtesy follows too close upon your rudeness
to be valued. I must go from here; but—how?”</p>

<p>She began to be amused by the situation and
regarded the angry man with a curious smile.
There was but one horse, and that one already
far spent. Miguel Cardanza had never walked
a step in his life when riding had been possible.
Anita examined her torn attire and wounded
hands, though these caused her little pain now,
since her young and healthful blood recovered
swiftly from any hurt. Yet now was a chance
to test how true a “gentleman” was the Señor
Miguel Cardanza!</p>

<p>Her laughing audacity nettled him and he remarked,
ungraciously:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“It’s miles if it’s a rod. Must I walk? Can
you? Well, then, bitter pills must e’en be swallowed.”</p>

<p>With that he swung Anita upon Lady Jane
and leaped into the saddle before her, then
goaded the doubly-burdened animal to its
swiftest pace. In this fashion and in due time
the ill-assorted couple appeared before old
Marta at her kitchen door, and set that astonished
person trembling and gasping at the extraordinary
sight, Miguel and Anita, riding
double! Indeed, and indeed! They had all
gone mad that day!</p>

<p>“Anita—the <i>podrida</i>—my son—”</p>

<p>During her return ride the girl had scorned
to support herself by so much as a touch upon
her cavalier’s belt, but she now coquettishly
clasped his sturdy waist and sweetly answered:</p>

<p>“Yes, Mother Marta, it is even so I bring
back your little son quite safe. Yet I have suffered
much, and it was that Amador who spilled
the children’s supper and— Hark!”</p>

<p>A shrill whistling sound silenced the words
on her lips.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THE NORTHER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“O, brother! We must ride fast, fast! We
must not stop one single minute—if they should
get us—why did our father go away!”</p>

<p>“Hush, little sister. Never fear. I am almost
a man. I will take care of you.”</p>

<p>“Boys are not men; not even ‘almost’ men at
twelve years. But—can they still see us from
Refugio?”</p>

<p>Turning, the child looked back. The trees
and shrubbery about the venerable home they
loved quite hid it from sight and the fact made
her suddenly sad, so that she cried:</p>

<p>“Suppose, just s’pose, we should never come
back?”</p>

<p>“Pooh! don’t be silly, girlie. Course we’ll
go back, soon as the ‘enemies’ go away,” answered
Carlos stoutly, though he was secretly
troubled by the same thought.</p>

<p>“What ever made them come?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Carlota! You told me that yourself: because
they were just—‘enemies.’”</p>

<p>“‘Enemies’ are wicked people, and I don’t
see how anybody could be wicked to our father.
Do you, Carlos?”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t ask so many questions. I am no
older than you. I can’t answer them.”</p>

<p>“You often say you are much bigger, you
were ‘almost a man’ a minute ago. Doesn’t
Benoni travel splendidly?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But—where shall we go?”</p>

<p>“Why, to the shearing-place, I s’pose,” she
answered, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“We can’t. They—anybody might come
there. All strangers go everywhere that
there’s things to see, like the shearing.”</p>

<p>“Oh! dear! I wanted to see if our lambs,
Santa Maria and San Jose, had been sheared.
But the men would not dare, I think. But we
must go somewhere, ‘to hide,’ Miguel said, and—what
shall we do?”</p>

<p>Carlos reflected; then observed:</p>

<p>“I can’t think yet. I hate ‘hiding,’ anyway,
and on our own rancho from such polite gentlemen—I
mean the Rupert-one was so. I feel
sort of mean and sneaky, as I guess a coward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
might. You may be a coward, Carlota, but I’m
not. I’ve a mind to go right home and order
those men to leave. If they won’t, I can lock
them up in—” Here he hesitated and looked
questioningly at his sister.</p>

<p>“Lock them up—where, Carlos Manuel?”</p>

<p>“You needn’t tremble. I haven’t done it
yet.”</p>

<p>“Where could you lock them?” she sternly
persisted.</p>

<p>Carlos fidgetted, then said:</p>

<p>“Girls ask so many questions!”</p>

<p>“And boys answer so few! You know that
there’s only one place in all Refugio that can
be locked. Our father never turned a key on
his possessions. I’ve heard him say that. I’ve
heard him say the whole world was free to use
what he used except—our mother’s rooms. The
key to those he took away. I saw him put it in
his pocket and he kissed me when he did it.
Carlos Manuel, would you put ‘enemies’ in our
mother’s rooms?”</p>

<p>Carlos evaded her piercing gaze, but answered,
firmly:</p>

<p>“It would be worse to keep them outside,
where they could hurt our father and us, than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
to put them into places which nobody uses and
where they could hurt nobody till they promised
to be good and go away.”</p>

<p>“Down in the inside of you, Carlos, you know
that locking them up there would be the worstest
thing could be. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I s’pose so. I wish there was some
other place.”</p>

<p>“So do I. But, first, let’s go to our mother’s
grave and think about it there. Maybe we’ll
guess just what to do, and if we should be gone
a long, long time— If we should never come
back at all—”</p>

<p>She began to cry but the lad exclaimed:</p>

<p>“We’ll never get anywhere if you cry all the
time. I never did see anybody cry as much as
you do. I wouldn’t be a girl for all New Mexico!”</p>

<p>They turned Benoni toward the flower-decked
mound and the pair knelt there for a
little time, each praying after his and her own
habit, and feeling vastly comforted by the
peaceful beauty of that sacred spot. Then
Carlos rose and went away, and Carlota called
to him:</p>

<p>“Brother, aren’t you coming back here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“No, sister. I’ve said good-by and now I
want to go. I’m getting my things in the
schoolroom.”</p>

<p>Carlota would have liked to linger, but now
joined her brother in the pretty glen beside the
spring; and, while he wound his riata and
thrust his hammer and knife into his sash, she
secured the basket which old Marta had given
them with their luncheon. Little of that was
now left; only a few scattered cakes, which she
carefully gathered again, thinking they would
answer very well for supper, in case they did
not arrive at “anywhere” by that time. She
also slung her botany-box across her shoulders,
which made Carlos inquire:</p>

<p>“Why are you taking that? If we do get
things we can’t bring them home to the garden.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re taking your hammer. If you
can crack stones I can pick flowers. You know
they’ll keep a week in my box, and we ought
to be home long before that. If—we ever
come at all!”</p>

<p>“We must first go before we can come.
Where shall it be?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“I know. I’ve thought it out.”</p>

<p>“Where, then, Carlota? Quick! Oh! how
the wind blows!”</p>

<p>“To find our father.”</p>

<p>“We don’t know where he went.”</p>

<p>“He went toward the north. He said he
was going there. That was where his business
led him. Our business is to follow and find
him. He is ours. He belongs. We always
do go to him in trouble, and aren’t ‘enemies’
trouble?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Out here I feel braver, and
not a bit afraid of those men. The old one,
that jiggled his teeth up and down when he
talked—that was the curiousest thing! like
he’d borrowed somebody else’s—he was real
old and wizzly-up. That one—he couldn’t
hurt a gopher! The Mr. Rupert was so pleasant
and—Carlota, I believe we’ve made a mistake.
They mayn’t be ‘enemies’ at all. How
could anybody take us away from our father if
he wouldn’t let us go and there was everybody
to fight for us? I believe that old Miguel—”</p>

<p>“Carlos, I—am—going—to—my—father.”</p>

<p>That settled it. Whenever small Carlota<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
made a decision it was final; and uncertainty
ended, the spirits of both rose. She now joyously
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“How jolly he’ll be over us! I’ll take my
little notebook, so I can put down all about the
flowers and things we find. Father always
teases me because I can so much easier forget
than remember.”</p>

<p>“You might better take your grammar, I
think!” gibed the boy, but she was not offended.</p>

<p>Gently patting Benoni she called:</p>

<p>“See him, brother! How queer he acts? As
if he couldn’t bear to go away from us. Never
mind, you darling. You aren’t going from, but
with us, and that’s quite different. You didn’t
think we’d leave you behind, did you, Noni
sweet?”</p>

<p>“Silly Carlota! Kissing a horse’s nose.
But he does act queer, though, and I know why.
It’s the wind. He hates it, and so do I. It—scares
me.”</p>

<p>“Now, who’s silly? I’m only a girl, but no
wind scares me. I love it. Let’s mount now
and ride, ride, ride! Fast and faster and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
fastest! Come. You’ve all you want and so
have I.”</p>

<p>Running to opposite sides of the gentle Benoni
they clasped hands above his back and
“trick fashion” leaped to their places upon it.
Their soft blankets were all the saddle they
used, and with a gay “Vamos!” they started
upon their search.</p>

<p>“How he does go! He acts just wild,
doesn’t he? And isn’t the wind getting terr’ble
cold?” asked Carlota, after they had ridden
northward for some distance without pausing.</p>

<p>Carlos glanced over his shoulder. His sister’s
teeth were chattering as she spoke, and
he had to press his own tightly together to
keep them still. But the fear which prevented
his replying had already risen in her own
mind and she added, brokenly:</p>

<p>“Dear, it’s a—‘norther’! We’re caught
in it. We—shall die. Refugio—let’s try—back—.”</p>

<p>She had never been exposed to such a wind-storm,
but he had once experienced something
of it. In terror he now recalled that bad
quarter-hour which his father and he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
passed before they gained a shelter. There
was now no shelter possible. They had steadily
ridden away from every habitation they
knew, straight over the plateau toward the
“north,” whither their father had vanished.</p>

<p>But Carlos’s latent manliness now asserted
itself. Benoni had become wildly terrified,
yet the boy managed to pull from beneath himself
the blanket which was flapping like a whip
and to order Carlota to put it around her.</p>

<p>“I—can’t! I—I—am—so—cold!”</p>

<p>He nearly lost his seat in struggling to do it
for her, and then Benoni took matters into his
own keeping. Swerving from the trail he had
been following, he bolted due eastward, and it
seemed as if he scarcely touched the ground
with his speeding hoofs, that even his strong
body was lifted and borne along by the blast.</p>

<p>Carlos strained his vision to see, through the
blinding storm of leaves and snow, that point
whither the animal was hurrying with all his
strength. But he could discover nothing and
cried, in anguish:</p>

<p>“Oh! my little Carlota, sister! If you were
only safe at home!” Then as her stiffening
arm stole round his neck he added, consolingly:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
“But don’t you worry, darling! I’ll take
care of my father’s little daughter!”</p>

<p>But she was already past speech, almost
past suffering; and realizing this even the
boy’s brave spirit succumbed and he let his
head fall on Benoni’s neck, wondering if he
were also dying.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the snow had covered
them all with its warm blanket and the children
lay beneath it, motionless, upon the back
of their faithful horse, which feebly struggled
on. Besides themselves there was no living
thing upon that wide white plain; for even the
roaming cattle which dwelt there had vanished
somewhere. Death stared the wanderers in
the face, but they had already passed beyond
consciousness of that.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>AT THE END OF SEVEN DAYS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. George Disbrow hated anything which
interfered with his personal comfort. Also, he
had “nerves” that, first and last, gave himself
and his neighbors a deal of trouble. Like a
caged creature he was pacing the refectory
and, when his son Rupert entered, demanded:</p>

<p>“Any news?”</p>

<p>“No, father.”</p>

<p>“Humph! You’ll go all to pieces yourself
next. Have you had your supper?”</p>

<p>“I—believe so. Yes—yes, indeed. I ate
something a little while ago. It’s all right.”</p>

<p>“I tell you it’s all wrong. We never should
have come to this beastly hole.”</p>

<p>“I certainly wish we hadn’t, but—under the
circumstances—we are not the ones to complain.
To please a crotchety old woman we
did come, bringing disaster with us, and whatever
treatment we receive we have deserved.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“If these people would organize a systematic
search they might be successful.”</p>

<p>“They’re working on something better than
system—upon an almost superstitious love for
the dead ‘Lady of Refugio’ and her lost children,
lost—through our fault!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Through the fault of that imbecile
Cardanza! The fact of such a hot-head-idiot
being left in charge proves just what sort
of man this Adrian Manuel is, and how unfit
to bring up even such stupid children as his.”</p>

<p>“Father, please don’t. I never saw two
more charming little ones, and even you admired
them, till they disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Which shows that I’m right again. At
twelve years, any American who possesses
common sense should know better than to be
frightened out of his father’s house by the
fairy tales of a blockhead foreigner.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rupert wearily smiled. His father had
rung the changes on this sad subject till nothing
new remained, and the son knew that a keen
self-reproach pointed the venom of the old
man’s words. He gently rejoined:</p>

<p>“It’s been a difficult business for a difficult
client from the beginning, and I never would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
have persuaded you to try a personal interview
with this man Manuel, if I hadn’t believed that
the trip here would benefit your broken health.”</p>

<p>“The fellow has been a fool to so stand in his
own light!” testily commented the elder lawyer.</p>

<p>“Once I thought so, too. Now I do not. I
believe he is one in a thousand. His life is an
ideal one and he made his wife supremely
happy. She could have missed but little by
what Mrs. Sinclair terms her ‘crazy elopement.’”</p>

<p>“You grow enthusiastic.”</p>

<p>“Who could help it? Witnessing how love
has transformed this old adobe ruin into such
a comfortable, even luxurious, home.”</p>

<p>Mr. Disbrow snorted in contempt. Then
pointed to the single candle burning in its silver
stick, saying:</p>

<p>“There’s your ‘luxury’! Now sit down in
that rickety old chair and write to Mrs. Sinclair.
It must be done sometime.”</p>

<p>Thankful for any diversion, Mr. Rupert
promptly obeyed, and the letter was barely finished
when Miguel stumbled in, so weary and
heart-heavy that he seemed older than the ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
Guadalupo. There had been no white
hairs on the <i>major-domo’s</i> black head till within
these last few, terrible days, and his once merry
eyes were dull and lifeless.</p>

<p>“Miguel, you must rest. You are the head
and front of all this search, and you dare not
fail,” pleaded the young lawyer, earnestly.</p>

<p>“I have failed,” hopelessly assented this
once fiery fellow.</p>

<p>He no longer resented the presence of these
strangers, these “enemies,” at Refugio. They
had done their worst and by his own stupidity,
his misguided zeal, he had aided and abetted the
ruin they had wrought. He accused himself of
being the lost children’s murderer, and was so
continually engrossed by such self-reproaches
that he was almost crazed. Indeed, he sometimes
prayed that he might become wholly so
for then he would forget his misery.</p>

<p>“Don’t say ‘failed,’ Miguel. I believe, I do
believe, those children will be found, safe and
well,” cried the other, unable to endure the
sight of the manager’s anguish.</p>

<p>“So do I. At—the Resurrection.”</p>

<p>“Long before that. Upon this earth which
they made lovely by their presence. Come.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Take heart again. Pluck up your faith and
courage.”</p>

<p>“They perished in the storm,” stolidly answered
Cardanza.</p>

<p>“We don’t know that. We have found no
proof of it.”</p>

<p>“Neither do you know this country. The
strongest cattle cannot live through a ‘norther,’
and my small ones were delicate, like flowers;”
pointing outward toward ‘My Lady’s Garden,’
where were rows of limp, dead lilies and drooping
heliotropes.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see. But the little Carlota was no
thin-blooded herb. Look again. There are
many plants left unharmed and wonderfully
green and fresh. Even of just such sturdy
growth were the Manuel children. At will accustomed
to sleeping out-of-doors, to a cold
plunge each morning, to an almost wholly out-of-door
life, sun-browned and of perfect health—why,
they are sure to be alive and thriving
somewhere. Only—we haven’t yet looked in
the right place to find them. But we shall. We
shall.”</p>

<p>Miguel’s face lightened somewhat and he said,
quite gently:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Stranger, you mean well, and you are a
fine fellow—whatever yon man may be. But
folks born fools can’t help it,” he ended, with
a significant glance toward the restless elder
gentleman.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Thank you. But, come.
Let’s have some supper. I heard that wise
mother of yours say that ‘A full stomach made
a light heart.’ A light heart should also give
a clear head. Let’s try her proverb and see
what it avails.” He held out his hand and
Miguel took it listlessly.</p>

<p>“One week, Señor Rupert. One week and
two hours, since they rode out of paradise—into
death!”</p>

<p>At this, Mr. George Disbrow completely lost
his temper and snapped out:</p>

<p>“You’re all a parcel of numskulls!”</p>

<p>“Father!”</p>

<p>“Fact. <i>Prima facie</i> fact. If there’s supper
to be had go get it. That old blubbering Marta
has never cooked a morsel that ever I heard of,
except that much-lamented podrida, which I
still believe is a myth. Anita—well, I’ll not
abuse her. Only for her we should all starve.
She’s no <i>cook</i>. Not by any stretch of imagination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
can she be considered one, all pepper and
spice—”</p>

<p>“Like herself!” suggested Mr. Rupert.</p>

<p>“Like nothing fit to set before an eastern
palate. Go get your supper. I’ve been looking
over this map that Adrian Manuel made of this
region and I find there are some habitations
marked to the north of us where other maps
show a plain space. Indicates what sort of
country it is when every mud-cabin has to be
named as if it were a town. I think— Never
mind. Go get your supper, if there is any.”</p>

<p>He was promptly left alone and as promptly
regretted it. Whatever happened now, he was
miserable. The refectory had been, by Marta’s
advice, given over to the use of and as a “cage”
for “that ne’er-be-quiet Señor Disbrow, with
the rattling teeth in his ugly mouth.” During
all that memorable week just past, the unhappy
gentleman had come in for all of the afflicted
Marta’s sharpness. Even Anita, who fancied
that she had herself run the gamut of the housekeeper’s
abuse, acknowledged that not until now
had she had “the pleasure of the acquaintance
of that most amiable Señora Cardanza, no.”</p>

<p>But now the dame had neither strength nor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>spirit left to abuse anybody. She ate little and
incessantly murmured her prayers, while she
slept scarcely at all. Nobody had suspected
her of such deep feeling, but she declared to old
Guadalupo, who alone had time to listen that:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_082">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_082.jpg" alt="SHE STARTLED THE MAID">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">SHE STARTLED THE MAID</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Being thrice a widow might be trouble for
some, yes. Yet not for Marta. I tell thee,
Guadalupo Sanchez, sorrow has not come near
me until now. It is so. In truth. Soul of my
life, Carlota! Where sleepest thou, my angel?
To the shearing would she go, no? Till I promised
I would not sing to my guitar with her
away. For I can sing, yes, in truth. She will
come if I sing!” A moment later she startled
the maid, who was serving the supper, with her
sudden cry. “Anita, Anita!”</p>

<p>“What now, mother Marta? I am busy, I.
Here is Señor Disbrow, and yonder is Miguel,
of the heavy heart; whom I used to tease but
only pity now.”</p>

<p>“My guitar, Anita! <i>Instante!</i> Maybe she
will hear it, our Carlota! Always it would
bring her. Always. Quick! the guitar!”</p>

<p>“<i>Ay de mi!</i> Woe is me! She has gone even
more mad. Well, mad folks must be humored!”
murmured the maid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>A few moments later, the two men taking
their food in the kitchen were startled by the
notes of the antiquated instrument and the curious,
quavering song which accompanied it.
Miguel, the son, shared Anita’s suspicion, and
cried:</p>

<p>“It is my mother! Her brain has now
turned. Ah! it is hard when the old must die
of grief.”</p>

<p>“Hark! That isn’t grief! That’s something
more—and different!” returned the girl,
listening intently.</p>

<p>For the song had abruptly ceased; been cut
in two, as it were, by some sudden interruption.</p>

<p>Mr. Rupert hurried outward as old Marta
hobbled inward, and they met on the threshold,
where, to the great peril of his eyes, she thrust
a thorny agave leaf into his face and, pointing
to it, gesticulated wildly. Also, she muttered
Spanish so rapidly that even Anita couldn’t
keep pace with half she said. At every few
words she motioned toward the outer court—then
back to the leaf again. Evidently, she was
frantically imploring Mr. Rupert to examine
it; but he now, also, believed her crazed.</p>

<p>It was the ancient Guadalupo who finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
brought reason out of this confusion. Without
troubling to move his head or alter his feeble
monotone he reiterated again and again:</p>

<p>“Before ink and paper was the Pueblos wrote
on leaves. Before ink and paper was. Before
ink and paper—”</p>

<p>“Hush! thou imbecile!” screamed Anita.</p>

<p>“No, he’s not an imbecile! No, no! Far
from it!” corrected Mr. Rupert, suddenly waving
the agave leaf above his head and fairly
prancing in his glee. “There is a message
written here!”</p>

<p>Whereupon Anita and “that crusty Miguel,”
as she had used to call him, found it convenient
to clasp hands and thus convince themselves
and each other that they, at least, were sane.
For, surely, this seemed a mad, mad world!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>BOTANIST AND MINERALOGIST</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Brother!”</p>

<p>“O, Carlota! Are you awake at last?”</p>

<p>“Was I asleep? I—I was out in the storm.
We aren’t riding yet, are we? Why is it so
dark? What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“It means that our splendid Benoni has saved
our lives. Saved our very lives, Carlota Manuel!
A horse! Benoni!”</p>

<p>The little girl struggled to raise herself. She
was strangely cramped and numb but there was
a warm breath upon her face and, putting out
her hand, she touched a velvety nostril.</p>

<p>“Noni! You dear! But how funny!
Seems as if we were all lying down together,
Carlos.”</p>

<p>“Yes. When I waked I was right against
his neck,” answered the boy, gently stroking
her shoulder, which he could only feel, not see.</p>

<p>“Where are we? Is it night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“I don’t truly know, but I think we’re in a
cave, or some place under ground. I’ve been
awake a long, long time. I thought you—you
were—”</p>

<p>“Were what, brother? Hold me tight. I
feel so queer. My head is whirling round and
round. What did you think?”</p>

<p>“That, maybe, you were dead. And your
head doesn’t whirl. How could it. Now don’t
cry. You mustn’t, Carlota. You—must—not!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t no intention, so there. Just because
I did once. I—besides, I promised not,
didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You’re real good, little sister.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you dear! That makes me feel better—almost
straight-headed again. For it did
whirl, Carlos, or it felt so. I wish I did know
where we are. Is it always dark in caves,
brother? And do folks ever get out of them?”</p>

<p>“Course. It’s not very high, and Benoni
must be the most smartest horse there is in the
whole world,” he answered, with an affected
courage.</p>

<p>“You didn’t say good grammar that time,
yourself, Carlos.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“Never mind. I think we’re in a cave or
covered up canyon that Benoni knew about and
had seen sometime when he was roaming. Anyway,
it’s a place he wouldn’t have come into
except he was in trouble. A ‘norther’ is trouble—dreadfullest
kind. People and horses die in
them, often. We must have gone to sleep on
his back and he crept in here with us and laid
us all down together. He knew that way we’d
keep warm. We did. I’m warm as pepper;
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’m warm enough, but my clothes are all
stiff, like they’d been wet, and I’m terr’ble hungry.”</p>

<p>“So am I.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try to get out and find something to
eat. I had a few cakes in my box. Do you
s’pose Noni rolled us off, or we rolled ourselves
off his back?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But we didn’t die, so we can
still go on to find our father—when we get out
of here. Let’s go now.”</p>

<p>“Wait. We’ve got to give God thanks, first.
’Cause it was He who made Benoni, a horse,
have sense to save us alive. Do you hear me,
brother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>He answered rather absently. He was as
grateful as she but he had not only heard her—he
had, also, heard something else: a dull,
creeping sound from somewhere beyond them in
this cavern. He hoped she had not noticed
this and was glad when she stood up and
stretched herself and, at the same time,
stumbled against something which sharply
rattled.</p>

<p>“Oh! my box! My precious old tin box!
For true, for true!” she cried.</p>

<p>Already, they fancied they could see a little
through this darkness and moved toward each
other till their hands closed together upon the
battered botany-box, which Carlota had always
carried with her on her rambles a-field. In
an instant she had opened it and joyfully exclaimed:</p>

<p>“The cakes! They are still in it! They are—they
are!”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! Oh!”</p>

<p>For the moment, their terrible hunger made
them almost like wild creatures. Almost, but
not quite; for just then Benoni put out his nose
and touched Carlota’s arm.</p>

<p>“Wait, brother. You must. It was Noni<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
who saved our lives and he’s hungry as we.
He shall eat before I do!”</p>

<p>“Not before, Carlota! Oh! not before! I—can—not—wait!”</p>

<p>Indeed, the boy’s voice had changed. At the
mere odor of food his misery overcame him,
for he had been awake much longer than his
sister had and was, by that time, much nearer
starvation. He frightened her, yet with infinite
tenderness she drew his head upon her shoulder
and with her free hand began to feed him.
Bit by bit, morsel by morsel—though, at first, he
snapped his teeth so greedily he almost bit her
fingers—she put the <i>bollos</i> into his mouth, coaxing,
the while:</p>

<p>“Eat it slowly, brother. Make it last a long,
long time, same as when we have Christmas
sweeties. Now, wait a moment, and I’ll give
one to Benoni.”</p>

<p>“Not yet, Carlota! I’m first—another—just
another!”</p>

<p>He did not know how few were the cakes she
had put into the box when they left the schoolroom
and supposed there were plenty for all.
She ignored her own hunger and managed to
keep back two for Benoni and was even able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
smile over the greater carefulness in receiving
them from her hand the animal showed than
the boy had done.</p>

<p>“Look, Carlos. Benoni takes his cakes like
a gentleman. He has—hasn’t bited—bitten—me
once. He’s nicer mannered than you, I
guess; yet, you poor dear, you never had to
eat your dinner in a cave before, did you?”</p>

<p>“Another, sister?”</p>

<p>“Oh! dear! It’s too bad, but there isn’t not
another single one. Not even the least bit of a
crumb for I’ve felt all around the inside of the
box to see. Never mind, when we get out we’ll
find something more.”</p>

<p>The famished boy smacked his lips and asked:</p>

<p>“Weren’t those the very nicest <i>bollos</i> Marta
ever made?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” answered she with a little gasp;
then hurried to add, lest she should betray that
she had not tasted one; “Benoni thought so,
too. There. He’s getting on his feet. Take
care, good beastie! Don’t you step on Carlota!”</p>

<p>There was little danger of this, for he could
see much better than they and he, evidently,
felt it time to leave this prison house. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
whinnied, shook himself, cautiously turned
around, and began to pick his way past them.
Afraid that he would leave them, the little girl
begged:</p>

<p>“Don’t go without us, Noni! Wait! You
mustn’t be faster than we. Hurry, brother!
I’ll take hold of his tail, and you take hold of
me, and he’ll lead us out that way. Come.”</p>

<p>“We mustn’t leave our things here. There’s
the box. Maybe, after all, there is another cake
left in it that you didn’t find. Besides our
blankets and hats, if we didn’t lose them.”</p>

<p>“You must be quick then. He will go. He
is determined. I’ll hold him back all I can,
but—”</p>

<p>Then again sounded that strange creeping,
and even Carlota heard it. So did Benoni.
For he made a sudden movement forward,
scraping his back as he did so, and began to
climb the slope down which he had carried them
to safety.</p>

<p>“That’s a funny noise! Guess there must be
bats in here. Anyway it surely is growing
lighter. Ouch! I keep stubbing my toes on
sharp pointed stones or heaps of stuff. It looks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
as if it were all a white place. Maybe, it’s been
whitewashed, same as Marta’s kitchen.”</p>

<p>At that, Carlos made his sister pause. From
what he had been taught by his father he
guessed what the “whiteness” meant:</p>

<p>“Oh! Carlota, we’ve stumbled into the beautifullest
cave! It is! I believe it! These sharp
points are stal-ag-mites. High up must be the
other things—stal-ac-tites! Father said he’d
take me sometime to a cave almost as wonderful
as that Mammoth one in Kentucky, and I
do believe we’re in it now! Oh! how glad I am
the ‘norther’ sent us to it!”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand such big words.”</p>

<p>“They’re no bigger than the ones you talk
about your old flowers.”</p>

<p>“My father says that real bo-tan-i-cal names
are just the same all over the world. It’s best
to learn them right in the first place, cause then
you don’t have to unlearn them afterward.”</p>

<p>“It’s just the same about stones. I couldn’t
explain to you, Carlota, since you’re only a girl;
but knowing about stones helps about mines.
If our father wasn’t a ge-ol-o-gist and a min-er-al-o-gist,
the rich men away off wouldn’t hire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
him, as they do, to ‘prospect’ and explore their
mountains.”</p>

<p>“Flowers help, too. Course. It’s this way,
Carlos. Try to understand. Funny! A boy
who knows most every rock there is doesn’t
know a dozen blossoms. Plants ‘talk,’ my
father says, to people who have learned their
‘language.’ The sort of plants they are shows
what’s in the soil they live on. All plants cannot
live on one soil. I—”</p>

<p>“Pooh! That’s a mistake, I guess. What
about our mother’s garden? Any flower—”</p>

<p>Benoni ended their discussion by going forward
again, after his brief rest. As they progressed
the light strengthened and they
stumbled less; and in the relief of this, Carlos
began to sing. But his song was interrupted
by a cry which set them trembling in terror.</p>

<p>“Ah, ho! Ah, ha, ho!”</p>

<p>The shout came from behind them, and its
echo through that ghostly place was very terrifying.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>PABLO, THE DANCER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was due to its steep slope that Benoni had
penetrated so far into the cave. To escape
from the ‘norther,’ he had fled down it, stumbling
and forced to go forward, till he reached
that level inner chamber where consciousness
returned to the children.</p>

<p>Now to reascend that narrow, jagged passage
was almost impossible. Yet the same instinct
which had guided him to safety remained with
him as he crawled, struggled, twisted himself
upward. The children clung to him, urged and
pushed him, in their frantic efforts to escape
whatever was pursuing them; for constantly
nearer and louder drew that curious cry from
the tunnel-like depths of the cavern. And, at
last, when their force was almost spent—they
found themselves in the sunshine!</p>

<p>The sudden light blinded them so that they
clapped their hands over their eyes to shut it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
out and even Benoni dropped his head and
blinked at the ground. Then, all at once, that
hoarse shout was in their very ears; yet, out
there in the open, sounding much feebler and
more human.</p>

<p>Carlota opened her eyes and peeped through
her fingers—stared—and bounded forward
with an answering cry of delight:</p>

<p>“Pablo, the Simple! Only our own Pablo— Pablo!”</p>

<p>The man stared back at her in return, blinking
at the light as she had done, till a smile
spread over his dull countenance and he began
to hop around her in that curious fashion which
expressed his keenest pleasure.</p>

<p>Carlos looked up and joined his recognition
to hers:</p>

<p>“Pablo, the Dancer! The Simple!”</p>

<p>At a glance the reason of the latter nickname
was obvious: the face of this middle-aged man
had little intelligence, though there was a certain
craftiness in his small black eyes. He wore
a blanket and the cast-off clothing of some
ranchman, while his head was partially covered
by a rimless straw hat. Around the hat was a
faded red ribbon on which some rude jester had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
painted the legend: “Razzle Dazzle, the Dancer,”
and the fellow wore it as if it were a royal
headdress.</p>

<p>His present “dance” continued until he was
tired; then he held out his hand for an alms.</p>

<p>“No, poor Pablo. I have nothing to give
you. Our father isn’t with us. How came you
here?”</p>

<p>He muttered something which Carlos could
not understand but Carlota’s sympathy interpreted.</p>

<p>“The storm? Yes, I know, we were in it,
too. There! Don’t shrug your shoulders any
more—you make me cold to see you! Yet, you
look well. I hope you aren’t hungry, Pablo, as
we are.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” He pulled a crust from his ragged
pocket and offered it to her; but it was black
from contact with the dirty cloth and, faint
though she was, she couldn’t touch it. She
could only look enviously at Benoni, who had
already nibbled a space in the grass. That, at
least, was clean. If she could but eat it, too!</p>

<p>“No? Hmm;” said Pablo, shaking his head
in satisfaction and returning the crust whence
it came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>Then the girl asked:</p>

<p>“Pablo, can’t you show us a place where
there are berries? Remember the Señor Manuel,
Don Adrian? He is your friend.”</p>

<p>At the question a new expression stole into
the beclouded face and, taking Carlota’s small
brown hand in his dirty paw, he gently stroked
it. All the good which had ever come into his
life had come through “Don Adrian” and the
dead “Lady of Refugio.” He remembered.
Such as Pablo do not easily forget. Once—he
didn’t know when—but he remembered, he had
been very ill. The fever had burned in his
veins and he had lain upon the mesa while the
sun had scorched him to death.</p>

<p>Then, in time, there had come between him
and the sun the shadow of a kindly face. The
face had bent above him and there had been no
shrinking in it. Pablo was used to seeing people
shrink away when he drew near. This
brooding Señor had not done so. He had put
a wet cloth on the hot head—he had put the
suffering “Simple” on his own horse—he had
himself walked a long way. They had come to
Refugio, to a great, white, cool room, where an
“Angel” in a white robe had ministered to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
sick one. Pablo had recovered, but—the “Angel”
had died.</p>

<p>The poor half-breed knew. He had seen
them put her in the ground and plant flowers
above her. After that, Señor Manuel had come
and sent Pablo away. With money in his
grasping hands, with clean clothing upon his
deformed body, with all kindness and charity,
yet still—away. Else, the “Simple” would
have stayed on forever in the cool, white rooms.
But the sad-faced Señor could not bear that.
The sight of the wretched creature, whose life
had cost a life infinitely more precious, was too
bitter.</p>

<p>In some dim way the “natural” understood
even that. So he went, sorrowfully but obediently;
and always thereafter, when he saw the
master of Refugio riding across the plateau
put himself out of sight. Yet, as the little children
grew up, they were told about Pablo and
their mother’s sacrifice for him and learned to
regard him with a sacred interest and friendliness.</p>

<p>After a moment’s apparent consideration of
her request, the half-breed darted away, disappeared
in the ground, as it were—whence he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
soon emerged. This time his hands were
heaped with food which even dainty Carlota
could enjoy; nuts of more than one sort, with
the fruit of an edible cactus, such as the children
often and eagerly sought.</p>

<p>Now, for a time, nothing was heard but the
cracking of nutshells and the munching of sharp
teeth; till, wholly refreshed, Carlos remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know how long we were in that
cave, but it must have been all night. While
we can, and it is daylight, I think we’d best go
on. My little compass says that way, yonder,
is north, and I do hope we’ll get to some nice
place before it’s dark again.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, brother. I’ve thought of
something. Marta and Miguel and everybody
may be worried, thinking about us out in a
‘norther,’ and I’m going to tell them we did not
die.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know how? If we go back those
men will be there just the same, likely. It was
you Carlota Manuel, first said we should go
to our father; and, even if you’ve changed
your girl’s mind I haven’t changed my boy’s
one.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t changed the leastest littlest corner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
of it, so there. But, listen, Pablo. Will you
do something for Don Adrian Manuel? Something
to prove you love him?”</p>

<p>“Umm.”</p>

<p>When he nodded so emphatically, she caught
her brother’s knife from the sash where it still
remained and ran to a near-by agave plant, and
cut one of its broadest leaves. Using its own
thorn for a pen she carefully printed on its
tough skin the few sentences following:</p>

<p>“The Norther didn’t Get Us. God and benoni
Took Care of us. we Cannot come Home
Yet. Carlos and Carlota Manuel.”</p>

<p>Then she placed the leaf in the Indian’s hand
and looking closely into his eyes, directed:</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Pablo. Listen the very sharpest
ever was and with no forgetting. Are you
paying strictest ’tention?”</p>

<p>“Umm.”</p>

<p>“You must go straight to Refugio. You are
to take this leaf to old Marta. You know her,
well. She is the old, old woman who gives you
bread and meat when you come stealing around
and my father is away. You are to give it to
her and nobody else. Who are you to give it to,
Pablo?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“Marta. She give Pablo chicken <i>tamales</i>.
Umm. Good.”</p>

<p>Before she could reiterate her instructions
he had started. He held the printed leaf in
both hands before him and steadfastly studied
it. Maybe he had never felt of such importance;
and if his vagrant mind could have kept
to one idea the precious missive would have
soon been in the housekeeper’s hands. As it
was, trifles attracted this unfortunate postman,
and he had wandered hither and thither in pursuit
of them, till it was on the evening of that
seventh day when he at length delivered it.</p>

<p>Where, at that hour, were the little runaways?</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>A PICTURE IN THE SKY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The searching parties from Refugio and the
neighboring ranchos had all gone east, west, or
south. To the north lay an unbroken mesa, or
plateau, having no shelter within a known distance.
Nobody dreamed that the children
would follow other than familiar routes, and the
first point explored was the “shearing-place,”
belonging to Refugio itself.</p>

<p>This was a cluster of adobe huts upon a little
stream. It was four leagues distant from the
Mission and, during the shearing, used as a
folding for the sheep-bands owned by Mr. Manuel,
though at other times these browsed upon
the plains or were driven into the mountains.
It was to this folding that old Marta had said
the lost ones were bound; and in looking for
them there the first false start was made and
the first valuable hours wasted.</p>

<p>Further than this, had Pablo fulfilled his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
promise promptly all might have been different.
But the idea of any fixed time did not enter his
narrow mind. His life was always a wandering
one and he was well known throughout that
whole wild region. Sometimes he appeared at
some railway station in the wilderness and, during
the train’s brief halt, amused the passengers
by his grotesque “dancing” and the idea
that he was an “Indian.” Though, in fact, his
mother was a Mexican and his feet most often
strayed toward the south. But he had many
homes; in caves and canyons or poor men’s
homes. Most people pitied the “Simple” and
a few feared him.</p>

<p>Such, then was the messenger dispatched with
the leaf-letter, and the twins watched him rapidly
disappear, while Carlos said:</p>

<p>“He’ll surely get to Refugio long before the
afternoon meal and I hope Marta will give him
plenty of nice, clean food. I wish I could have
some, too. Nuts and things like that are nice
for a finish but a nice lamb chop—my!” Then
he observed Carlota still gazing wistfully after
the vanishing Pablo and added, sternly: “Carlota,
don’t you stand and watch him that way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
First you know you’ll be running back yourself.”</p>

<p>“Brother, I never! Unless you—”</p>

<p>“I what?”</p>

<p>“Want to go, too.”</p>

<p>“Course I do. Course I will. When—I find
my father.” He put his arm about her and
firmly pointed northward.</p>

<p>Her gaze followed his and beheld a vast, sun-heated
plain. It wasn’t an attractive outlook,
yet if that were the way to her father’s presence
she could travel it cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Come on. Let’s hurry.”</p>

<p>“Benoni, come!”</p>

<p>The horse stopped feeding and looked at them
earnestly, as if in his mute way he were asking
to go back to his pleasant corral; they shook
their heads, decidedly:</p>

<p>“No, no, good boy! Not till we find your
master. Then we’ll all go home together.”</p>

<p>Then he stood very quiet while they mounted
him. All his dash and spirit had departed, and
he was as grave as if the whole responsibility
of the situation rested upon him.</p>

<p>“The dear Benoni! He looks as if he feared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
we’d get into more trouble. He’s such a wise
darling!” exclaimed Carlota.</p>

<p>“There goes another of a girl’s imaginings.
I wouldn’t be a girl for—for anything!”</p>

<p>“I like being a girl, so that’s right for both
of us. Which way?”</p>

<p>“North, of course. The compass tells.
Wasn’t that the way we started?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I thought, maybe, the storm—there’s
nice mountains over yonder,” suggested
the sister.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe, they’re far enough north.
We’ll go to them. They do look as if they’d be
cooler, and in mountains there are always canyons
and holes to sleep in. I wouldn’t mind
sleeping on this mesa if it hadn’t been for that
‘norther.’ If another should come.”</p>

<p>“It won’t. They’re only in great whiles, you
know. Make Benoni go. He’s lazy, the dear!
He’s had too much grass.”</p>

<p>Indeed the handsome creature did need urging.
He was loath to turn away from that direction
in which his old home lay, and it was
with a very different pace from his usual one
that he again set forward.</p>

<p>Then cried Carlota, in fear:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“Carlos, he isn’t lazy! He’s sick. He
surely is!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! He needs encouraging, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>After a trick he had been taught by a horse-trainer,
once resident at Refugio, the lad leaned
forward and whispered in the animal’s ear.
The ruse seemed to succeed. Benoni quickened
his steps to his usual graceful lope, which jarred
his riders no more than the swaying of a cradle.
This movement was so natural and familiar that
their own spirits rose. To a gay little melody
which he had learned from Anita, Carlos began
to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“We’re going to our father, oh! we’re going to our father,</div>
<div class="verse">We’re going to our father on this happy, sunny day!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Carlota joined him to the best of her ability,
though she had often to pause in admiration of
his genius, which could work into the rhythm
details of home happenings and even the things
they passed by the way. He, also, thought his
sister’s voice the sweetest ever heard; and thus,
in their absorbed pride in each other they travelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
far before they realized how intolerably
warm it was and how Benoni was again sorely
lagging.</p>

<p>“Never mind. We’re almost to some little
hills. There are trees on them and so there
must be water. I guess a drink is what we all
want.”</p>

<p>“But, brother, we mustn’t drink him while
he’s warm,” warned Carlota.</p>

<p>“I shan’t drink him warm or cold, silly child!
But now we’ve thought of it, aren’t you dreadful
thirsty?”</p>

<p>“Terr’ble. If it’s there, I’ll fill my tin box
with the water when we go on again.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we won’t go any further to-day. I
wonder how far we are from Refugio!”</p>

<p>The boy regretted his words as soon as uttered,
for his sister turned and looked backward
over the sun-beaten plain in such a homesick
way it made his heart ache. His head also began
to ache and he made Benoni take a right-angle
course to that they had been following.
The trees were directly in their line of vision
now, and Carlota cried:</p>

<p>“Oh! they’re only a little bit off now!”</p>

<p>He was wiser in plain-lore and answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“They may be ten miles. The air’s so clear
one can’t tell.”</p>

<p>“Oh, brother! Why, they look as if I could
almost touch them!”</p>

<p>“I know that, dear! If it weren’t so—awful—hot!”</p>

<p>Suddenly Benoni stopped, as if he had come
to the end of his strength. Surprised and
frightened, the children leaped down and examined
the jaded beast, while Carlota sobbed:</p>

<p>“We shouldn’t ought to have made him
‘carry double’ in this heat. We’re so terr’ble
big now-a-days, Carlos.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m afraid we’ve been pretty selfish.
After he saved us, too!” admitted the
lad.</p>

<p>“His head’s the hot place. Wait. I know
what Miguel does sometimes, when he’s afraid
Amador has overheated himself.”</p>

<p>With that she began to break and bruise the
leaves of an herb growing near, saying:</p>

<p>“I don’t know if they’re the right sort, but
they will be wet and cool. If his head aches,
like ours, they may ease it.”</p>

<p>“How will you keep them on? Miguel takes
a big handkerchief or a strap.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“Why your sash is just the thing. You can
put your hammer and knife in my box till we
get the water. There. I’ll do it. I’m a girl.
I know how to make it stick.”</p>

<p>But she had to remount in order to reach the
animal’s head and when she had finished she
thought that Benoni looked very funny, indeed.
She laughed:</p>

<p>“He makes me think of an old woman in a
cap!”</p>

<p>“He looks sort ashamed of himself, doesn’t
he?”</p>

<p>Yet, after a few moments, it was evident that
the beast felt refreshed by the cool application
and Carlos exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Good! If it’s helping him it will be nice
for us, too.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll bruise a lot and we can put them
in our hats and walk to the hills. I shall not
ride poor Noni another step till he gets well.”</p>

<p>This simple craft, of the crushed leaves, was
of infinite value to the straying children, who
sturdily pressed forward toward the mountains—though
these seemed to retreat rather
than draw nearer. After they had been walking
for a long time, till they were almost exhausted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
Carlota stopped and clapped her hand
to her eyes, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Oh! I see things! Houses, and trees, and
queer, rushing wagons! Water, too! Water,
water! But they’re all upside down—they are
all coming out of the sky—head first!”</p>

<p>Carlos had seen such strange “pictures in
the sky” when he had been a-field with his
father and understood what she meant.</p>

<p>“A mirage—that’s what it is, just a mirage.
Which way? Maybe I can see it, too.”</p>

<p>She pointed out the curious thing and the
lad studied it attentively, then explained:</p>

<p>“I know what those queer wagons are. See?
They are leaving the houses—they are going—going—away.
They are like the pictures in
the books, when you hold the page wrong side
up. They are—railway—cars—and—an—engine!”</p>

<p>“Will they come here and hurt us? Like
those other pictures of the accident in the
newspaper?”</p>

<p>“Pooh! No. They are a long way off, and
cars can run nowhere except on a track made
for them. A track, try to understand, Carlota!
is a pair of iron or steel rails laid on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
ground. The car and engine wheels are fixed
on these rails and so they move.”</p>

<p>Carlota wrinkled her brows, then said:</p>

<p>“The way you tell it isn’t very—very understand-able.
But how long is the pair of rails,
brother?”</p>

<p>“Hundreds and thousands and, maybe, millions
of miles. All around the whole world, I
guess.”</p>

<p>She could not believe this statement. At
first, she thought he was merely teasing her by
its boastfulness, then feared that the heat had
turned his brain. Maybe her own had been
touched by the sun, too. Maybe there wasn’t
any picture in the sky. And oh! how thirsty
she was! She turned toward Benoni, and
cried:</p>

<p>“Why, brother! See how rested Noni
looks!”</p>

<p>“Yes. But—you don’t act as if you felt very
well yourself. Are you sick, too?”</p>

<p>“I guess not. Only, do you s’pose we might
ride just a little way, now, Carlos?”</p>

<p>“We must. I’ll help you on him.”</p>

<p>“Not ’less you do, too.”</p>

<p>Another moment, and they were both back in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
their old places on the horse’s back and he appeared
to have acquired a new strength. He
lifted his grotesquely bandaged head, whinnied,
worked his nostrils, and started forward at a
swift pace. Then, clinging to him and to each
other, they dropped their heads and went to
sleep; and it was Benoni’s stopping which made
them again open their eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh! Water! Oh! Water—rocks—trees—berries—berries—berries!
How good, how
good!” fairly shouted Carlos.</p>

<p>At last they had reached the hills! and, at
once, all three of the weary pilgrims had their
mouths in the little stream which ran among the
rocks and were drinking deeply of the saving
water.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>FRIENDS IN NEED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Thus refreshed, they all—even Benoni—dropped
upon the grass which bordered the
stream and again fell asleep; and it was the
horse which first awoke. The neighing of one
of his own race aroused him and he made an
effort to rise; but, with a pathetic appeal in his
great eyes, sank back upon his side. Another
moment and the neighing, accompanied by human
voices, was close at hand. A mustang’s
head was pushed through a break in the scrub
and a shout followed the head:</p>

<p>“Here we are! Yo-ah-ho! Water! Water!”
Then the shout was checked by the exclamation:
“What in the name of—redskins! Indians—Wh-e-aw!”</p>

<p>By then, Carlos had sprung up and, in the
daze of first awakening, was staring at the intruder.
He did not know that it was his own
peculiar attire that had suggested “Indians,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
and he had never as yet seen a hostile red man.
But the tone frightened him. He seized Carlota
and forced her to her feet, while beside
them lay poor Benoni, unable to arise. Thus,
for a time, the twins stood, motionless, clasping
each other, with their terrified expression slowly
changing to delight as they gazed at the several
men in uniform who now approached them.
All were horsemen and some were leading instead
of riding their thirsty beasts.</p>

<p>“Soldiers!” whispered Carlos to his sister,
and she smiled.</p>

<p>Often she had heard her father talk of the
“brave soldier boys” who kept those wide
plains safe from the unknown tribes of savages;
and her smile revealed to the foremost
cavalryman that he had not now to deal with
the child of a detested race.</p>

<p>“Hello, there! Where in the world did you
come from, papooses?”</p>

<p>The question was asked with a smile so kind
that Carlos laughed as he answered:</p>

<p>“We aren’t papooses. We’re regular white
Americans.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t look it, with that brown
face! Where do you come from?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“We came from home, Señor,” answered
Carlota, because her brother was now absorbed
in watching the other cavalrymen and heedless
of the question.</p>

<p>“So ho! Well, where is ‘home’?”</p>

<p>“Refugio.”</p>

<p>“Hello! Hel-lo! That so? I’ve heard of
that rancho. It’s a long way from here. Where
are the others of your party?” still queried
the officer.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any others.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? No others? Only you two
kids?”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, Señor Soldier, but we’re not
kids. We’re children, just regular American
children. We only wear kid-skin clothes, <i>charros</i>;<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
that’s all. Because our father says it is
the very comfortablest and best dress there is
for children who live as we do. We’re almost
always out of doors, you see, and in these things
we are ready for any fun that’s going.”</p>

<p>“I should think so, indeed, or for any business,
either. Your father is a sensible man,
that’s as plain as a pipe-stem. I’ve heard
about him. Where is he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“Oh! have you, Señor Soldier! But that’s
what we don’t know, what we’re trying to find
out.”</p>

<p>The gray haired officer sat down and drew
the little girl to his knee. The action was so
gentle and fatherly that it banished her slight
self-control and flinging her arms about his
neck she sobbed:</p>

<p>“Oh! you dear sir! Won’t you help us find
him? We thought it would be easy, but he is
so far, so very far away!”</p>

<p>“There, there, little lass! I’ll do my best,
surely. I’m a soldier, you know. It’s my business
to help little maids when they need help.”</p>

<p>Carlota instantly stopped crying and kissed
the grizzled Captain upon his stiff moustache,
saying:</p>

<p>“I knew it! The very minute I looked into
your eyes I knew that you liked little children.
We’re not so very little, you know, but I guess
we’re little enough to be liked.”</p>

<p>“I reckon so! But what was there in my
eyes that told you that about me!”</p>

<p>“A twinkle. Folks who don’t love little children
never twinkle their eyes.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, you observant small woman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
Yet you guessed right. I’ve a little miss of my
own, away back in the east, getting educated to
come out and help her old daddy, by and by. I
shouldn’t like to have that young daughter right
here now, in this particular spot, if she didn’t
have any ‘others’ with her. Begin at the beginning,
tell me your whole story, and make it
short.”</p>

<p>The Captain motioned for Carlos, also, to
join them, but the lad remained standing and
watchful. He was not as sure as his sister that
these strangers were friends, for what Miguel
had said about the Disbrows had altered his
faith in life. He feared that it might be a soldier’s
duty to arrest runaway people and he
preferred to be on his guard.</p>

<p>In the simplest, clearest manner possible the
girl told their brief history, and when she had
finished, the cavalrymen grouped about the little
spring had gained a very vivid picture of
the far-famed Refugio rancho. Then said the
Captain:</p>

<p>“Thank you, my dear. That was excellently
told; but, if I had a chance, I’d send you
straight back to your deserted home—or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
nearest guard house! I’m afraid you’ve done
a mighty foolish thing.”</p>

<p>She looked so puzzled that he continued:</p>

<p>“Those gentlemen were not your ‘enemies,’
but your friends. They came to offer you a
kindness, and there’s one thing I’m going to
teach you in this other outdoor schoolroom, a
lesson of military discipline, and that is: The
first duty in life is obedience. I put it with a
capital O. Say it after me, so you’ll never forget
it: ‘The first duty of a soldier is Obedience.’
That lesson fits little girls even better
than it does my lads, here.”</p>

<p>She repeated the time honored maxim, but
added:</p>

<p>“I’ll remember; yet I don’t see how I’ve disobedienced
any.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it you who proposed this runaway
escapade?”</p>

<p>“It was I who decisioned about going to our
father. We are going, too,” proudly.</p>

<p>“Of course, you little Eve! Still dabbling in
that same old apple business, hey?”</p>

<p>Everybody except Carlota laughed, and a
brother soldier asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Say, Captain, isn’t that rather deep for a
New Mexican baby?”</p>

<p>“Probably, Lieutenant, though the principle’s
the same. If <i>she</i> hadn’t proposed this
wild-goose-search, her brother wouldn’t have
thought of it. But she did; here they are;
country full of Apaches; now—what can we do
with them?”</p>

<p>Carlos hotly interposed:</p>

<p>“You needn’t do anything. We’re not
afraid. We know lots and lots of Indians.
None of them would hurt us. If Benoni is
rested we will go on, right away.”</p>

<p>“Good enough, lad! There’s the making of
a soldier in you, and I hope you’ll go to the old
Point some day. As I remarked, if I hadn’t
far more serious business on hand I’d send you
back to Refugio, under a military escort. As
it is—Little girl, are you hungry?”</p>

<p>Two or three of the men had begun to eat
their rations at a short distance from their
superior officer, and he saw the child watching
them. This reminded him that he would, himself,
be the better for food.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m all right, thank you. We had
something to eat—once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Is that so? I did, too, but I’m ready to eat
again.”</p>

<p>He gave a wordless command and the soldiers
prepared a little woodland feast which the
young Manuels never forgot. It was army fare,
rather stale and hard, but it was as “manna in
the wilderness” to the famished children.
Watching them, the cavalrymen prolonged their
own meal and, in another sense, also shortened
it; for the twins ate as if the supply were inexhaustible
and, as the Sergeant observed:</p>

<p>“No tellin’ where you’ll be when you’re hungry
next time!”</p>

<p>“Time’s up!” called the Captain, and sprang
to his feet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>THE END OF A NOBLE LIFE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Carlos and Carlota also rose. They did not
know what these new friends, who had met and
fed them, would do, but they felt that they were
not yet to part company. The Captain settled
it:</p>

<p>“Youngsters, I’m on the ‘war path,’ and I’ve
tarried too long already. Since to leave you
alone would be worse for you, you’ll have to
take the chance of trouble and go with us.”</p>

<p>He was vexed and stern. He hated the
charge of two children upon his hazardous
chase after the troublesome Apaches, whom he
was determined to punish if he could meet
them.</p>

<p>“If it comes to a fight between the redskins
and us, ‘the boys around the monkey’s cage had
better get away,’” remarked a subaltern to his
neighbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>The Captain overheard and grimly smiled.</p>

<p>“Master Facetious may desire to ‘get out of
the way’ himself.” Then to the children: “Do
you both ride one horse?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Señor Gray Moustache, our Benoni.
But he acts terr’ble queer.”</p>

<p>“Sergeant, see what’s up with the beast.”</p>

<p>Saluting, the man replied:</p>

<p>“Captain, I reckon it’s all ‘up’ with him.”</p>

<p>“What? You don’t mean it! That adds to
the charm of the situation. Not a led horse in
the squad. Not even a mule.”</p>

<p>The perplexed officer hurried where Benoni
lay upon his side, piteously gazing upon his
young mistress. In his eyes was a sure intelligence.
He knew perfectly that the march was
to be resumed—and not by him. In that cavern
down which he had slipped and stumbled
during that dreadful “norther,” and out of
which he had struggled by an almost impossible
effort, he had received some mortal hurt. He
could not tell them his agony. He could not cry
out, as a human would, but he could and must
beseech them—not to leave him!</p>

<p>As yet, Carlota did not understand. She saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
that her beloved horse was loath to rise and she
bent over him with a jesting reproof which
strangely moved her hearers.</p>

<p>“Come, Noni! You darling, old, lazy fellow!
Come. We’re going now.”</p>

<p>More than one soldier smiled at her trustfulness
in themselves, yet sighed to think she was
there. She was a brave little thing, yet bravery
counts for nought with a maddened redskin.
They had found traces of the Apaches and knew
they had struck the right trail. A conflict was
inevitable. But Carlota only knew of her
horse’s distress, as she cried:</p>

<p>“Benoni, dear! Darling Benoni! What is
the matter? Can’t you, won’t you, get up?
I’ll walk all the way. So will Carlos. But we
can’t leave you here. You’ll have to come, too.
You’ll feel better, by and by. With all these
nice, nice horses to keep you company. Not
alone any longer, Benoni. Lots of horses,
Noni.”</p>

<p>The listening officers exchanged glances.
They could not further delay. On account of
these children they had already lost valuable
time, and to waste more, because of a pet horse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
would be impossible. So the Captain laid his
hand on Carlota’s shoulder, saying:</p>

<p>“My little girl, we must go now. Your pretty
beast will have to stay. Bravely say good-by
to him and come.”</p>

<p>“Good-by? To Benoni Manuel? Alone in
the woods? Why, you must be—you must have
forgotten that Benoni saved our lives!”</p>

<p>“And so lost his own, my dear.”</p>

<p>“But he hasn’t lost it. He’s alive.”</p>

<p>“Scarcely. Very soon he will have passed
away.”</p>

<p>Carlota’s heart felt very queer. She turned
faint. When she loved anything—and she
loved most things—it was with all her soul.
Hitherto, death had meant nothing to her; but
now, looking into the sober face of her new
friend and the appealing eyes of her pet, the
sadness and finality of it struck her like a blow.</p>

<p>She went down upon the ground and tried to
lift Benoni’s head upon her knee, but she could
not, it was too heavy. Yet she could and did
throw her arm over his neck and press her wet
cheek to his delicate nostrils.</p>

<p>“Benoni! Benoni! The ‘Good’! You mustn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
die—I can’t bear it! I cannot. Carlos, come!
Maybe he’ll hear you if he doesn’t me. Come,
come quick! He never disobeyed us, never.
He won’t now. But say it sharp, brother. I
can’t. Tell him to get up. That we’ll take him
home. We will. We’ll let the other go.
Straight home—if only—”</p>

<p>Carlos knelt beside her. Both had now become
oblivious of the soldiers’ presence. Their
first great sorrow had them in its grip. Though
their mother had died they had been too young
to know her loss. Their father had left them,
for a time, but he would return. Yet this relentless
thing which was stealing Benoni—how
could they bear it?</p>

<p>Silence closed about the central group. A
horse is more to a cavalryman than to others,
and the Captain stood with bent head, eager to
be away, yet loath to disturb the sacredness of
that moment. The young subaltern, whom his
superior had dubbed “Facetious,” felt a
strange pain in his throat. Till then the raid
had been a “lark,” a something to break the
monotony of camp life. Full of enthusiasm
concerning his first skirmish with the redskins,
the possible outcome of the affair had not entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
his mind. Suddenly, he seemed to see his
mother’s face. As that noble Benoni was dying
in the wilderness so might he die—that very
day.</p>

<p>All at once Benoni groaned and desperately
tried to lift his head. His eyes brightened, his
ears bent forward, his whole attitude was that
of intent listening. He was frontier born and
bred. He had been in a deadly conflict between
white men and savages, and he had not forgotten.
Horses never forget that which has terrified
them in their youth. Something too faint
for ears not sharpened by agony was on the
air. Would those whom he loved hear it in
time?</p>

<p>“Noni! You precious! You are trying to
tell us something! What is it, my pretty
beastie? Oh! you brave, beautiful fellow! I
cannot remember when you weren’t always
with us. You must not, must not die now!”</p>

<p>Poor Noni! It was useless. They would not
be warned. He could serve them no further.
His dumb, silent life had been one long example
of duty faithfully performed. His virtues had
been many, his faults few. He had been well
loved and he had loved much. He had done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
what he could and he would sleep now. His
glazing eyes fixed on the face of his little mistress,
but she could not see his parting gaze
because of the tears which filled her own.</p>

<p>Just then, while the deeply moved old Captain
stooped to raise Carlota to her feet, the
sanctity of the forest death-chamber was invaded.</p>

<p>“Sw-w-ish!”</p>

<p>Something whizzed swift and sharp between
soldier and child, grazing his shoulder and her
blond curls, and buried itself in the herbage a
dozen feet away.</p>

<p>It was the arrow of an Apache!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>BY THE CAPTAIN’S ORDERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Toward sunset of that same day the little
squad of cavalry was slowly crossing the plain.
It would not reach camp that night and was
watchful, though not expectant, of assault.</p>

<p>“I reckon the redskins had all they wanted
for this particular time!” exclaimed the lad
who had longed for battle, till he had seen Benoni
die, and afterward had dreaded it. However,
the whizzing arrow had as promptly banished
the dread, for it had barely escaped the
breast of little Carlota. From then he had
fought like the born hero he was, and his Captain
was now regarding him with a grave smile
of approval.</p>

<p>“Yes, but not for long. There was sin in
their eyes. We shall have work and plenty of
it.” And, after a moment, the officer spoke to
the girl who rode before him on his horse:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
“I’ve a word or two to say to you, Carlota. I’d
better say them now, before—”</p>

<p>“Oh! Señor Captain! will they come again?”
she cried, in terror. “Where can we go? It
is so dreadful!”</p>

<p>“I go wherever my duty calls. What to do
with you is the question. At present, I can
neither take nor send you to the fort. It’s too
far. A little way to the north of us is the railroad.
One of its stations should be in our direct
line of march, and if we reach it, if all goes
well, I will leave you children there.”</p>

<p>“Shall we see any more Apaches?”</p>

<p>“Humph! You’re not so fond of Indians as
you were, eh?”</p>

<p>“I never saw that kind before. Many, many
have been to Refugio, but they’ve always been
good.”</p>

<p>“We soldiers believe that the good Indians
are all dead.”</p>

<p>“Already, Señor Captain Gray Moustache?”</p>

<p>“Well, there hasn’t been a cataclysm to swallow
them, as I know. There, don’t stare; but
if ever you come in the neighborhood of a dictionary
look that long word out. ‘Gray Moustache’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
will bother you no more with a humor you
don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“I understand—some, dear Señor. And I
didn’t mean that name for harm. I always do
name people something like them till I know
their regular one.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? Wish to be properly introduced,
do you? Well, my name is Sherman. But I
like my nickname and, please, don’t look so like
a scared kitten. It’s never so bad but it might
be worse. The old Padres named that spot
we’ve left behind us the ‘Spring of Happiness’
in the ‘Mountains of Flowers.’ We found it
so, too.”</p>

<p>“Why—where—Benoni died?” she asked, reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Where we didn’t die. Where
several of the tricky skunks who would have
killed us in ambush were not permitted. The
greatest regret I have is that, though he is
past feeling wounded pride, we were obliged
to leave your noble horse in such vile company.
There were a half-dozen dead Apaches in the
glen when we left it, and a half-dozen white men
so much the safer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>When they had again proceeded in silence for
some distance, Carlota asked:</p>

<p>“Don’t Apaches go to railroad stations? and
do they keep children at them?”</p>

<p>“Under the circumstances, yes, to the last
question; and to the first—there’s little danger.
There are too many trains passing. If
only, you midget, you were safely at home!”</p>

<p>“I will be, some day, after we find our father.”</p>

<p>“After all your experience, haven’t you
dropped that crazy notion yet? You are a
child of ordinary common sense, I hope, Carlota.”</p>

<p>“Yes. That’s why I don’t see what else
there is to do but to go on.”</p>

<p>“If a person does wrong I never heard that
it was wise to keep on doing it!” said the worried
Captain, testily.</p>

<p>“Have I done that?” asked the child, really
astonished.</p>

<p>“I call it wrong to make trouble and anxiety
for a great number of people, as your running
away from home must have done. Even for
me, of whom you never heard before.”</p>

<p>Carlota wriggled herself aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“I will get right down, Señor Captain.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the kind. Remember
what I’ve said, and I’ll scold no more. I will
leave you two at the station. I will have telegrams
sent east and have an advertisement put
in the leading newspapers of the country. If
the news comes to your father, as it probably
will, and certainly should, your troubles will be
over. He’ll attend to the rest. This is what I
mean by your causing me trouble. I shall do all
this, not because you had any right to put it
upon me, but simply for humanity’s sake.
Now, next time you are tempted to act foolishly,
stop and think if you’re going to worry anybody
else with your silliness. That’s all.”</p>

<p>It was the sure end of the severest lecture
Carlota had ever received, and the worst of it
was that she felt she deserved it. She could
only say that she was truly sorry and resolve
to “do a lot of thinking next time before she
did any acting.” Then she added, as a bitter
memory was stirred:</p>

<p>“I begin to understand that if we hadn’t run
away from Refugio our Benoni wouldn’t have
died.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast, little girl, toward that conclusion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
The issues of life and death belong to
God. We have no concern with them. Our
business is to do right, as nearly as we can, and—now
let’s try a canter!”</p>

<p>At that moment a trooper rode up and
saluted.</p>

<p>The Captain gave permission to speak and
with a surprised attention, listened to the other’s
few words. Carlota tried not to hear that
which was not intended for her and was sadly
startled when her “Gray Moustache” gave her
a hasty kiss on the tip of her nose and said:</p>

<p>“That’s for good-by, my child. I learn that
to take you to the station myself would carry
me far out of my way, for my first duty now
is at camp. I will write some directions on a
leaf from my notebook and enclose some money
with it. You must give it to the station-master,
the telegraph operator, and he will attend to the
matter. Good-by, and a prompt reunion with
your father!”</p>

<p>To lose this soldier, whom she had regarded
as her own especial friend, seemed a terrible
misfortune, and her eyes filled as she felt herself
set upon the ground, while, with his squad
about him, the Captain loped away. Then she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
saw that Carlos was beside her and, also, that
two troopers had been assigned to their escort.
However, the faces of these men had neither
the sternness nor the quizzical pleasantry of
their commander’s. They were the faces of
those detailed to perform a troublesome duty
while their own desires were elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Bouton, you take the girl and I will the
boy.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>One horseman caught up Carlos and one Carlota,
and, without another word, rode off like
mad across the plain. They handled the twins
very much as they would have handled bags of
meal, and they took a direction at right angles
from that followed by their commanding officer.</p>

<p>Carlos’s temper flamed and he opened his lips
to remonstrate against such contemptuous
treatment, but remembered the Apaches just in
time to restrain his hot speech. It wouldn’t
do to anger his guardians then and there, and
he did not know that they would not have disobeyed
the Captain’s orders to vent their own
spite. Thus they traveled for what seemed
hours. Then they came, all in the starlight,
to a strange place where were two shining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
things laid flat along the ground and the light
of a lamp showed through the window of a solitary shanty.</p>

<p>The cavalryman who carried Carlota dismounted
and struck his saber against the cabin
door. After a brief delay this was opened by
a rough looking man, who held a candle above
his head and was speechless from astonishment.</p>

<p>The troopers saluted and said:</p>

<p>“By Captain Sherman’s orders, these children
are to be left here until further notice.”</p>

<p>The twins were promptly deposited upon the
ground, where they clasped hands and tried to
realize this new thing that had befallen them.
Before they could do so, their military escort
had again saluted and disappeared in the distance,
leaving them to make the best they could
of their forlorn situation.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>A FIRST RIDE ON THE RAILWAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Come in by!” at last said the man in the
doorway.</p>

<p>The children silently accepted the invitation
and entered a bare little room, to be instantly
startled by a yell of dismay from their new
host:</p>

<p>“Injuns! Injuns! Apaches! The Saints!”</p>

<p>“We are not Indians!” retorted Carlos, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Och! is it so?” gasped the man, much relieved.
“But it’s wearin’ their clo’es ye are.
Did they catch ye and rig yez like that? And
did thim soldiers catch ye back out of ’em?”</p>

<p>Despite his roughness, the man had a simple
and timid speech, and the boy replied by a brief
account of their adventures, ending with the
question:</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with us now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“As sure as me name’s Dennis Fogarty, that
thing I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Do you live here?”</p>

<p>“Live, is it? Faith, nobody lives nowhere
in this haythenish land.”</p>

<p>As no reply followed this assertion, Dennis
strengthened it by adding:</p>

<p>“It’s livin’ I’ve not done since I left Connemara,
an’ that’s the truth I’m tellin’ ye. This
station of ‘Leopard’ has give up. The folks
what run it has moved on a peg, to the station
beyant. ’Tis with them I stays when I stays
anywhere. But it’s mostly workin’ the track
all alone I am, barrin’ Mike Grady and a hansel
o’ ‘Greasers’, to help. It’s lonesome as sin, so
it is. Moreover—”</p>

<p>Of his own accord, there seemed no prospect
of Dennis’s pausing, so Carlota interrupted:</p>

<p>“The Captain said we were to wait at the station
till we were called for by our father. Is
this all the place there is?”</p>

<p>“Stay here, is it? All by your lone?”</p>

<p>“I—don’t—know. Is it the railroad? Are
those shiny things outside the rails? Do the
trains come to-night?”</p>

<p>“Sure, yourself is a girrul, now ain’t ye?
By the questions ye put all to once. Let’s take
’em in turn an’ find out.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_138">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_138.jpg" alt="“THE CAPTAIN SAID WE WERE TO WAIT”">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“THE CAPTAIN SAID WE WERE TO WAIT”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>The face of the lonely track-walker now shone
with delight at his company and, as soon as he
had heard Carlota speak, he recognized that
she belonged to a higher social class than his
own. He pulled his forelock when he addressed
her and his manner was both respectful and
protecting.</p>

<p>“Is it the railroad? ’Tis that same. Are
the rails the rails? They be. Do the trains
come to-night? Why not? Same’s every other.
But it’s not for a train I do be waitin’. As
I was a-sayin’, the folks that lives here doesn’t.
They’ve moved down to the next station on
‘Tuttle,’ more by token there’s more good
wather for fillin’ the ingines an’ drinkin’,
whilst here the bottom’s dropped out. Was a
well sunk, one o’ thim artaysians, same’s all
down the track, yet somethin’ or ’nother pumps
it out down below, as fast as it fills an’ faster.
So, says the Superintendent, says he, to Misther
Burnham, says he: ‘Take the traps of your
misthress an’ childer’ an’ go there,’ says he.
So they went, a week maybe; an’ ’twas I just
stepped back here, the night, to look for me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
shovel that’s lost. I’m abidin’ a hand-car will
be along, by and by; an’ I’m thinkin’ how Mike’ll
be starin’ at a couple o’ Injuns, for passengers
on it.”</p>

<p>“But we must stay here, right here. The
Captain talked a deal about ‘Obedience,’ and
his orders were: ‘Stay.’ So we must,” said
Carlota, firmly.</p>

<p>“But, sister, there is nothing to eat and nowhere
to sleep!” protested Carlos, who had not
himself been “lectured.”</p>

<p>“There is the floor. And we can find something
to eat—to-morrow. We need only just
sleep, till then.”</p>

<p>“An’ it’s not here ye’ll try it!” returned
Dennis, indignantly. “What’s a Captain more
nor a man?”</p>

<p>“He’s a soldier. A gentleman. He knows.”</p>

<p>“He knows nought. He isn’t the ‘Super’, is
he? He hasn’t the charge o’ the railroad same
as of soldiers an’ Injuns.”</p>

<p>The discussion was closed by a rumbling
sound, which grew steadily louder, and made
Carlota clasp her brother’s hand. He, also,
looked toward Dennis with a new fear, almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
as great as her own, till he saw the trackman’s
face beaming with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“There she comes, alanna! An’ I’m mindin’
the face o’ Mike, me friend, when I trots the
pair of ye out an’ he sees ye, first off. Here’s
me shovel—that’s right; an’ me pick, that I’ll
maybe need an’ maybe no. Ye see, it’s up an’
down the road I goes an’ it’s botherin’ to know
where’s handiest to be leavin’ me tools. Howiver—step
out lively now, whilst I shuts to the
door.”</p>

<p>“Who is ‘she’? And I must not go, nor must
Carlos!” declared Carlota, with decision.</p>

<p>“Sharrucks! Out with ye, ye purty, silly
girleen! Stay here, is it, alone? To be scalped
by the murderin’ Injuns? An’ is Dennis me
name? Out with ye. Be a duck of a colleen
an’ bother no more. It’s the car, I tell yez, an’
she’s all but come to the door. I’m thinkin’ it
may be the worse for us all if we hinder her,
for ’tis a single track an’ big Number Nine’s
about due. If we’re to meet up with a bed this
blessed night, it’s be ready we must when Mike
slows her up.”</p>

<p>Carlota shrieked and darted back toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
shanty, for at that moment there came into sight
a low, rapidly moving thing which seemed to
threaten them with instant destruction. But
Dennis slipped his strong arm around her,
saying:</p>

<p>“Sure, little misthress, ’tis nought but a
hand-car will take us to supper an’ bed. Fear
nought, fear nought.”</p>

<p>“Is it far to this ‘Tuttle’ place?” asked Carlos,
now more excited than alarmed.</p>

<p>“A matter of a dozen mile, belike. Hi! Here
she be! Hello, Mike!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Dennis! Who’s them?”</p>

<p>“Injuns! Didn’t ye hear them Apaches was
makin’ fresh trouble the now?”</p>

<p>“Quit foolin’, man! If ’twas redskins ye’d
got, ’tisn’t Dennis Fogarty’d stand there, grinnin’
that gait. On with ye and your company,
wherever they come from. I’m long behind an’
Number Nine overdue,” returned the other, not
easily duped.</p>

<p>Then Carlota was swung to the little platform
car, her brother beside her, and the men were
working the handles which propelled it over the
rails. For a moment or two, the children felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
as if they were being hurled to ruin; then the
sensation of flying exhilarated them, and they
cautiously looked about them.</p>

<p>“Isn’t—it—wonderful! Will it—run off—the
rails?” whispered Carlota.</p>

<p>But nobody heard her; though a little later
Carlos put down his head and halloed in her
ear:</p>

<p>“I should like to ride like this—forever!”</p>

<p>She did not answer, save by an ecstatic
squeeze of his hand. Then all at once, she
caught sight of a dark object lying on the
ground, which they whizzed past and left behind.
After another short distance, a similar,
uncanny, motionless body; and her heart sank
drearily. These were the carcasses of dead
cattle which had been too ignorant to get out
of the way, had been slain by passing trains.
In fresh terror she hid her face on her brother’s
breast and waited for her own direful end.
Then on and on, till it seemed she could not
endure the agony of suspense, and thought:</p>

<p>“I’d rather be killed quick—quick—than wait—this
way!”</p>

<p>But, at last, with a little jerk the car came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
a standstill and Dennis cheerily called out:</p>

<p>“Misthress Burnham! Hello, Jack! Go tell
your mother, lad, to come see the fine present
I’m after bringin’ her. A pair of young papooses,
to be raised along with yez all!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>GETTING ACQUAINTED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>As the trackmen and their charges stepped
into the little circle of light made by one kerosene
lamp nobody spoke. The Indian-like attire
of the young Manuels deceived the Burnham
household, till the mother’s gaze rested
upon Carlota’s face. Then she comprehended
that here was a child of white parentage, nor
of a class common to the plains, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“You poor little creature! Come in, come
in!”</p>

<p>As the little girl looked up she, also, realized
that here was somebody different from old Marta
and the lively Anita. The woman’s face was
thin and worn but showed refinement, as did
the modulations of her quiet voice.</p>

<p>“She speaks like our father,” thought the
wanderer and, impulsively, flung her arms about
the stranger’s neck.</p>

<p>The embrace was cordially returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“My child, you have found friends. Wherever
you come from you are safe with us. Come
into the house, all of you. Come.”</p>

<p>“That settles it!” commented a boyish voice,
and somebody laughed. “What Ma says, goes.
But where in the name of—”</p>

<p>“Jack, my son!”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” with a mock humility.</p>

<p>“Take care of your tongue.”</p>

<p>“Ma, that’s too big a contract, without your
help. But, who are you, anyway?” he demanded,
turning to Carlos, who had become
adept in telling his story; and who had now
scarcely finished it when there came a rumble
and jar which startled the Manuels, and sent all
the listeners to their feet.</p>

<p>“The express!”</p>

<p>Another moment and all had hurried to the
outside platform, to watch the incoming train,
Carlota and her brother with the rest. These
two were greatly excited and, as before, the girl
was terrified. Perceiving this, Mrs. Burnham
drew the child to herself, saying:</p>

<p>“Don’t tremble so, my dear. It cannot hurt
you, and, if you had lived long in this desolate
region you would welcome every train that arrives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
as a blessed link between you and civilization.”</p>

<p>So Carlota tried to conquer her fear and
stand quiet, while the great “Overland” with
its dazzling headlight rolled up to that tiny station
on the plain. Yet, even when it stopped
and the passengers began to step out of the
curious carriages, that they might stretch their
stiffened limbs in a momentary walk, she shivered
before the monstrous thing as before a
Juggernaut which must crush her if she moved.</p>

<p>Then she heard greetings exchanged between
those who had arrived and the station-master’s
family. The boy, Jack, was hail-fellow-well-met
with strange men in blue-jean suits, much
begrimed by soot and oil. He even caught a
flaming light from the hand of one and went
bobbing about beside the cars, looking at the
wheels and tapping them with a little hammer,
as if he were in charge of the whole affair.</p>

<p>The trainmen jested with him, asking: “Is
she all right, lad?” “When are you going to
join the crew, Jack?” and so on. Dennis was
here, there, and everywhere; and Carlota was
sure that, at all times, he was rehearsing her
own story till, presently, she found herself surrounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
by staring strangers in a most unpleasant
way.</p>

<p>Tuttle was a water-station and the trains delayed
there longer than at most other points.
Over in front, where the engine puffed and
breathed like a living monster, some men had
dropped a big, canvas pipe from a huge, high
tank, over whose sides the water was splashing
wastefully. The little girl’s thoughts flew to
her mother’s garden and the care with which
each drop was there hoarded and expended.
Then she heard, as in a dream, all the staring
people talking, as if she were deaf and could
not be offended.</p>

<p>“Apaches.” “Fight in the mountains.”
“Escaped with their bare lives!” “Wonder
if we’ll be attacked!” “Left here by the cavalry.
Will be shipped east to their friends.”
“Captives all their lives.” “Father an Indian
chief.”</p>

<p>Her head was dizzy. She could but dimly
feel that these remarks concerned her brother
and herself; that they were as untrue as possible;
and that she had no strength left to correct
them. Then she saw another woman’s face
bending close to her own. One of the many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
faces which had come down from the car, as
the water was coming down from the tank yonder.
Like the water, the faces were wasting
themselves in vain. She wished they could be
stopped. Especially, she wished this last
woman would go away. She was old and she
spoke in a shrill, cracked voice.</p>

<p>“Indian captives, are they? How interesting!
I’ve crossed the continent a dozen times
before, yet these are the first amusing Indian
relics I’ve ever seen. Apaches, eh? Decidedly
thrilling. I wish—”</p>

<p>“A-l-l A-b-oar-d!”</p>

<p>Slowly, the great pipe swung back to its own
place on the tank. The blue-jean figures, with
their flaring torches, climbed into the already
moving train. The curious passengers hurried
to their “sections,” to dream of hold-ups and
an Indian outbreak. Once more the heavy, jarring
rumble filled the whole earth; then gradually—swiftly—completely
passed away. Upon
that platform in the wilderness there was once
more left but a handful of people to face the
night alone.</p>

<p>Carlota’s tired, excited brain was full of visions;
and Carlos clasped his hands in a momentary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
despair for that far off House of Refuge,
whose safety he had so unwisely left. Alas!
the world was not that always brilliant, sunshiny
place he once had fancied it, and a sob
rose in his throat.</p>

<p>“Come on! my White-Around-the-Gills-Young-Brave!”
cried Jack, bringing his hand
down with a ringing slap on Carlos’ shoulder.</p>

<p>“Take care!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m doing. It’s getting near
midnight and I expect you’ll have to share my
lofty chamber. So, march, propel, come along,
<i>vamos</i>! For an Indian, you’re the slowest—”</p>

<p>The word died in its utterance. A blow, as
well directed as it was unexpected, settled upon
Jack’s wide mouth with a force that sent him
staggering backward.</p>

<p>Carlota instantly rallied from her half-swoon
of fatigue, and screamed:</p>

<p>“Carlos! Carlos! My brother! Boy—boy—go
away!”</p>

<p>She would have rushed between the combatants
had not Mrs. Burnham, though herself
vastly astonished, restrained her; while Dennis
flung himself into the business, hot foot.</p>

<p>“Go it, gossoons! Faith, the little one’s the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
better one! Och! Jack—that’s a silly blow!
The little one! THE LITTLE ONE!”</p>

<p>So crying, he hopped and pranced about the
little platform, in high glee, and, presently,
found it too small to accommodate his rising
spirits.</p>

<p>“Here’s to ye, Mike, me friend! Sure it’s
the nate night for wrastlin’. So it is, so ’tis.
Now, isn’t that the purty sight? Eh? an’ ye
would, would ye? Come on then! I’m for
ye!”</p>

<p>When Mr. Burnham emerged from the tiny
office, wherein he arranged his business concerning
the passing trains, he found the lads
in a fierce scuffle at the very threshold while,
on the ground outside, rolled Dennis and Mike
in a frenzy of contest, yet that was, moreover, a
perfectly friendly and familiar one.</p>

<p>In the “ould counthry,” both trackmen had
been famous wrestlers and had won prizes at
their parish festivals. Therefore, in this new
land, they lost no chance to keep themselves in
practice, and now stood up to shake hands with
the best of good nature.</p>

<p>“Faith! That was a fine one, Mickey, me
boy. Thanks to ye!” cried Dennis, the victor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“The same to yourself, Mr. Fogarty. If
there’s one thing out of Ireland I likes more
nor another, ’tis a good wrastle with a neighbor,
betimes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, I know. Clears a man’s head
betther nor a Sunday o’ sleep. Let’s turn in
now, Mr. Grady, an’ leave the misthress in
peace.”</p>

<p>So, with their arms about each other’s shoulders,
in a fashion beautiful to see, the late belligerents
departed toward a small outbuilding
where they slept and, in an incredibly short
time, were oblivious to all the world.</p>

<p>Then directed Mr. Burnham:</p>

<p>“Follow their example, lads. Go to bed, and
no more nonsense.”</p>

<p>For an instant, Jack and his guest regarded
each other, then both sheepishly laughed—which
astonished the wide-eyed Carlota even
more than their brief fight had done.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, little girl. They’ll be good
friends now. Boys often begin their acquaintance
by a ‘scrap,’ test one another that way, so
to speak,” explained the station-master.</p>

<p>“I never saw him do such a dreadful thing before.
Never—never—never! I—I—it’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
mis’able world! And I wish—I—was in—my
own—Refugio!” wailed Carlota.</p>

<p>In her heart, Letitia Burnham echoed that
wish, but aloud she cheerfully said:</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty good world, after all, my child.
But come, you poor, tired dearie. I’m going to
put you to sleep in my very own bed; and to
show you the prettiest sight in the wide west—I
think—nay, I am sure!”</p>

<p>Wondering what this might be and how anything
very lovely could be in that dreary place,
Carlota sleepily followed her new friend to the
inner room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE NEXT MORNING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>When Carlos awoke he saw Jack standing in
the middle of the small room where they had
slept, trying to put on his own kid jacket and
this absurd attempt of an overgrown youth to
squeeze himself into a garment several sizes
too small was so absurd that the watcher giggled.</p>

<p>“Hello, you! Laughing at me, are you? I’d
like to know why?”</p>

<p>“You can’t get into that. Besides, I want
it myself.”</p>

<p>“Can’t have it. It’s become the property of
Burnham and Co.”</p>

<p>“Is it time to get up?”</p>

<p>“Past time. Too late for breakfast.”</p>

<p>Jack said this so gravely that Carlos was disturbed,
though he lingered to stretch himself
thoroughly and to look curiously around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
chamber. Save the shack at which he had been
dropped on the evening before it was the barest
place he had ever seen. Even a sheep-herder’s
hut had more of convenience about it, but he had
gone to bed in the dark without observing this.
After the manner of lads, the pair had long lain
awake exchanging confidences, until Mr. Burnham’s
voice from somewhere had warned them
that there must be silence.</p>

<p>“Oh! dear! I wish morning hadn’t come so
soon!”</p>

<p>“Mid-day, you mean. Near dinner-time.
Where’d you get this jacket, anyway? I’d like
to shoot a red man and steal one for myself.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you, then?”</p>

<p>Jack ceased struggling with the garment and
whistled.</p>

<p>“Humph! You’re ‘sassy,’ too. But come
on. Get up. Here. The mother has been in
and says you are to put on these.”</p>

<p>Carlos sat up and stared at the outfit which
the facetious Jack held toward him. It consisted
of a blue-jean costume, similar to that
worn by the trainmen, save that this was clean,
if faded, and was one Jack had outgrown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p>“Her name is Letitia, if it’s Mrs. Burnham
you’re mentioning.”</p>

<p>Carlos sprang up and put on his stockings
and moccasins, but failed to find his leggins.</p>

<p>“I want to dress. What have you done with
my clothes?”</p>

<p>“I told you the truth. My mother has them.
Wait. She shall speak for herself. Mother!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jack!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this boy to put on my old clothes? He
says he won’t.”</p>

<p>“Dear lady! I never!” he cried, indignantly,
to the person without, who answered, promptly:</p>

<p>“For the present, Carlos, it will be better if
you wear the things I left for you. After
breakfast I will explain. I’m going to cook it
now, so please don’t delay,” returned the voice
from without.</p>

<p>“There, Jack Burnham! You’re an untruthful
boy!” said Carlos, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Hold on! That’s serious!”</p>

<p>“Breakfast isn’t over.”</p>

<p>“It is. Dennis and Mike had theirs two
hours ago. I saw them go by the window.
They stopped to look in and shake their fists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
at you, ‘friendly like.’ They’re good wrestlers,
the pair of them. Between us we’ll give you
plenty of exercise. Hello! Who’s that wants
to come in? Why?”</p>

<p>“To see my new bruvver.”</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked Carlos.</p>

<p>“That—is the future Governor of New Mexico.
Or President of the United States. Teddy
Burnham—here you are!”</p>

<p>With that he admitted a dark-headed little
four-year-old, very short and fat, and whose
brown eyes were the sharpest possible to a childish
face. This youngster planted himself firmly
just within the room and ordered:</p>

<p>“Boy, come here, Teddy wants to see you.”</p>

<p>The stranger laughingly obeyed.</p>

<p>“So you are Jack’s brother, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yep. I like the girl to you.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. Most people do. She’s much
nicer than I am.”</p>

<p>“Yep,” agreed the child, unflatteringly.
“Now talk Injun.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how. Say Jack, I cannot wear
these things!” holding up the overalls and making
a funny grimace that sent Teddy into a
paroxysm of laughter. The effect of his remark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
was so unexpected that Carlos, also, laughed,
and not to be outdone, Jack joined in the mirth.</p>

<p>“Isn’t you d’eadful!” shrieked the baby
“Governor,” and then they all laughed again.</p>

<p>This served the purpose of putting everybody
on good terms; for, despite their confidences of
the night, daylight had found the lads secretly
shy of one another. Now they coolly faced and
scrutinized each other. What Jack saw, we
already know; save that Carlos, clad in the
rough clothing of a workman, had lost something
of his refinement of appearance, while he
had gained in manliness. What Carlos saw
was an overgrown lad of fifteen, shock-headed,
freckled, with arms and legs two sizes too large
for his width of chest. A face that was brimful
of fun and good nature, honest, gray eyes, and
a mouth wide and upturned at the corners over
strong white teeth.</p>

<p>Yet, although he instantly liked him, Carlos
had a feeling that one could place little dependence
upon Jack. As he afterwards expressed
it to Carlota: “A fellow anybody could make
to do anything that was pleasant but nothing
that wasn’t.”</p>

<p>When they were dressed, Jack opened the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
door and pointed out the bench beside the wall,
where a tin basin and one coarse towel served
the needs of the entire family’s toilet.</p>

<p>“I see. Thank you. But isn’t there any
stream near?”</p>

<p>“Stream? No. Not by a long shot. What
you want a stream for?”</p>

<p>“Why, for my bath.”</p>

<p>“Are you so dirty? Anything the matter
with you that you must wash yourself?”</p>

<p>His face dripping from its plunge in the small
basin, the guest looked up, surprised.</p>

<p>“Nothing the matter, except that I haven’t
dipped—all over—since I left home and I’ve
ridden miles and miles. Of course, I’m dirty.
How could I help being?”</p>

<p>Jack whistled.</p>

<p>“Whew! Is that the kind of a fellow you
are? Well, then, the sooner you get over such
namby-pamby notions the better. This isn’t
any place for a ‘tenderfoot.’”</p>

<p>“I’m not a ‘tenderfoot’. I’m a born Westerner.
But it’s neither decent nor healthy not
to keep your body clean,” retorted Carlos.</p>

<p>“It’ll be healthy for you not to put on any
‘frills’ here, my Young-Fuss-and-Feathers!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
And there’s Ma calling us to breakfast. High
time, too. I’m hungry enough to eat hay.”</p>

<p>Carlos, also, was hungry; and anxious about
Carlota, who had been so tired on the previous
night; so he hurried into the house. This had
but three rooms. The larger was the living
room of the family and the waiting place of
what few passengers ever entered it. A small
desk, where Mr. Burnham kept his accounts,
was in one corner, and a table, covered by an
oilcloth square, was in the middle.</p>

<p>A girl ran forward from behind this table and
clasped Carlos in her closest embrace. For a
moment, he did not recognize her. The golden
curls which had always been simply brushed,
then left to nature’s will, were now put back in
a rigid little braid that completely altered the
child’s appearance. Her picturesque garments
had been replaced by a blue print frock, ugly
in shape and color; while the clumsy skirt which
draped her limbs gave them an awkwardness
of movement most unlike the hitherto graceful
Carlota.</p>

<p>But it was she; and with her soft clinging
arms about his neck and her sunshiny smile
greeting him, the lad realized that the world was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
not yet empty of all he had held dear and familiar.</p>

<p>Jack looked on, amazed by this rapturous embrace
between the twins. In that household expressions
of sentiment were rare, save on the
mother’s part toward little Teddy. She idolized
him, and it was he—sleeping rosy and
tumbled in his “trundle,” whom she had shown
to Carlota, at bedtime, as “the prettiest sight
in the world.”</p>

<p>But—kiss a girl? A boy—a sister?
“Whe-e-ew!” said master Jack, and whistled
so loudly that the twins loosed their arms and
looked at him in surprise that was tinged with
alarm. Their experience of yesterday had left
them both apprehensive of what might happen
next.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Carlos. Then,
since no answer came, he crossed to where Mrs.
Burnham was dipping mush from a kettle and
gravely bowed over the hand she kindly extended.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Madam. I hope you have
rested well.”</p>

<p>In her surprise, the poor lady nearly dropped
the dish of hot “suppawn.” She had already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
been touched and gladdened by the earlier civilities
of Carlota. They reminded her of a past
that was widely different from the present, and
of a time when she, too, had had time for the
small amenities of life. But to have the lad,
also, remember to be courteous sent a faint flush
to her cheek and a grateful warmth to her heart.</p>

<p>“Thank you, yes. Fairly well. And you?”</p>

<p>Jack could no longer whistle. He had to sit
down in order to properly recognize this “airish”
gentlewoman who had stepped into his
mother’s shoes, and he sat thus, staring, when
Carlota discovered him. She went directly to
him and offered her hand in greeting, saying:</p>

<p>“Good morning, Jack. Teddy has told me all
about you and what a splendid brother you are.
I’m sorry I called you a bad boy, last night, but
I thought you were going to—to kill my
brother.”</p>

<p>“Gophers! I guess he ain’t easy killed.
I—” He hesitated and uneasily glanced toward
his mother. He had never felt so big and
clumsy. He thought the little girl wasn’t half
as pretty in his sister’s clothes—My! but the
mother must have liked her to let her wear
them!—as she had been in that queer, Indian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
attire of her own. Wow! Wouldn’t that
plaguey breakfast ever be ready? In his most
boyish manner he demanded this and with so
much more disrespect than usual that Mrs.
Burnham stared, then smiled to herself, as she
quietly answered:</p>

<p>“It is ready for those who, also, are ready.
But you haven’t finished your preparations, my
son.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what you mean?”</p>

<p>She touched her head significantly and he
understood. The family comb had done faithful
duty on Carlos’s curls, but Jack, wishing to
impress the “tenderfoot” by his own manly
independence had, for once, omitted that part
of his toilet which Mrs. Burnham had, hitherto,
compelled. Affecting a rude disdain, he now
slouched forward to the table, but chanced to
look at Carlota.</p>

<p>She still retained that wide, innocent outlook
which commonly belongs to earlier childhood,
and her blue eyes regarded him with open astonishment.
He was a curiosity to her. She
had never seen anybody like him. He was on a
par with the hand-car, the railway, the Apaches—any
and all of the novelties which confronted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
her in this land of the strangers. All her life
she had been accustomed to the exaggerated
courtesy of the Spanish dependents at Refugio
and to the exact politeness of her gentleman
father, who believed in example rather than
precept. These little civilities were as natural
as the breath in her nostrils and, above all that,
the name of “mother” suggested a personality
higher than mortal.</p>

<p>She exclaimed, in a low tone:</p>

<p>“He is saying that—to his—mother!”</p>

<p>“Yes. But, for his own sake and in justice,
I will explain that he is exhibiting himself in a
new character,” observed that lady.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Ah! why? Probably, my dear, because he
is a—boy! A being whose nature, as yet, is
all at sixes and sevens; but who will arrive at
a true manhood, by and by, please God.”</p>

<p>As she spoke she smiled at her son and yet
she sighed; and it was due to Carlota that as
he hastily left the room he returned an answering
smile. When, after a brief delay, he came
back his head had been deluged with soapsuds,
which still trickled over his blue jumper, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
his shock of hair was plastered as smooth as if
it had been glued into place.</p>

<p>Then, while Mrs. Burnham bowed her head in
the “silent grace” that was a remnant of her
former life, the sun stole through the window
of the cabin and touched their reverent forms
with a glory all his own. Even so the busy
housemistress felt her heart brightened by the
presence of these young strangers and silently
wondered:</p>

<p>“Are they ‘angels unawares’? I have a feeling
that they will prove such.”</p>

<small>THE BURNHAMS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>When the simple breakfast was over, Mrs.
Burnham bade the lads remain indoors for a
moment, saying:</p>

<p>“I want to explain to you, Carlos and Carlota,
why I had you make this change of clothing.
One reason is, you will feel better for putting
on fresh, even if plainer garments. I do not
suppose you always wore the one costume when
you were at home, did you?”</p>

<p>Carlota laughed and replied:</p>

<p>“No, indeed! We had plenty of changes,
though all were made the same.”</p>

<p>“So I judged. Also that, probably, there
are no other children in this country attired in
just that fashion.”</p>

<p>“My father thought it was the very best sort
of dress for us,” returned the little girl, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Dear child, I do not doubt it for a moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
and I wish nobody need be more hampered by
their clothes than you have been. I see, too,
that those simple skirts you have on now are a
burden to you, but you’ll soon get used to them.
Maybe soon, also, you’ll return to your own
home and habits.”</p>

<p>As she said this she sighed and Teddy
shrewdly remarked:</p>

<p>“She doesn’t not believe it, though. She
allays bweaves herself that-a-way when she
doesn’t not sepect fings.”</p>

<p>They all laughed and the mother exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why, Teddy! How observant! Yet small
boys are not the truest prophets. There are
other reasons why it is better you should keep
your kid garments—”</p>

<p>“Kid, kidder, kiddest. Kid garments, garments
of a kid. A pair of kids,” mumbled Jack
who had, by this time, quite forgotten the
silent rebuke of Carlota’s eyes. Carlos heard
the monologue and was inclined to resent it but,
instead, found himself listening to Mrs. Burnham.</p>

<p>“So I will wrap them carefully, and mark
them with your names and addresses. You
should keep them with you. The blankets and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
the other things which the troopers left with
you at Leopard are here in my room. They
may be useful to you, and aren’t apt to wear out
soon. The blankets are the finest I’ve ever
seen, though some of the Indians who pass here,
on the march, have those nearly like them.”</p>

<p>“They were gifts to our mother. They were
woven by some Navajo women to whom she’d
been kind. She was always kind to everybody.
My father says that she nursed the sick, gave
drink to the thirsty, food to the hungry, and
rest to the weary. Oh! dear lady, I think you
must be like her!” cried Carlota, impulsively.</p>

<p>Letitia Burnham’s eyes filled. She had already
taken the motherless wanderer into her
inmost heart and had welcomed her as a gift
from God which she was thankful to retain,
even for a little time. Yet she was greatly concerned
for her small guests, knowing how slight
a thing may turn the current of a life, and how
doubtful it was that news of their whereabouts
would at once bring their absent father.</p>

<p>Before he had retired, Mr. Burnham had
promptly acted upon the suggestions in Captain
Sherman’s brief note. But, would the telegrams
and advertisements reach the eyes for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
which they were intended? And the Captain’s
information had been very scant.</p>

<p>Adrian Manuel had gone “north”, but nobody
knew where. The children had never been told
the name of their great aunt, Mrs. Sinclair, nor
even, until the Disbrows’ arrival at Refugio, of
her existence. Then Miguel had spoken of her
as “a wicked old woman”, and had honestly
considered her such—simply because she gave
annoyance to his master. Neither child had
mentioned the lawyers save as “enemies”, and
the further cross-examination which the Captain
had intended making in the presence of the
station-master—for their mutual benefit—had
been forgotten in his hurried departure elsewhere.
After he had parted from his little
charges he had remembered this fact, but trusted
to the station-agent’s intelligence to learn
what more there was to know.</p>

<p>Moreover, for some time past, Mrs. Burnham
had lived in expectation of a removal, and this
fact, added to the foregoing, made the children’s
future a doubtful one.</p>

<p>Household duties were simple in that narrow
cabin, and though there was always sewing to be
done, that could be taken out of doors. So, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
soon as the place was in order, Mrs. Burnham
took Carlota’s hand and said:</p>

<p>“Come, I have one other treasure to show
you. Bare as this isolated station may seem
to you I have learned to love it. We have lived
here for some years and were only temporarily
at Leopard. I didn’t wish to go there and was
glad to come back, because of—that!”</p>

<p>Carlota’s gaze followed the pointing finger.
At some little distance from the cluster of buildings
was a small heap of stones. Around the
heap there had been set a slender fence of
tule reeds, strung together by strips of the
same growth. A cactus, larger than ordinary
and loaded with brilliant flowers, stood at one
end of the enclosure while at the other a struggling
tree made a bit of shade. A rude shed
had been fixed beyond the spot, and within this
a bench, whereon Mrs. Burnham and Carlota
now sat down.</p>

<p>“What lovely blossoms! We have some cacti
of that kind in our mother’s garden.”</p>

<p>“This one blooms—in my child’s.”</p>

<p>The girl looked up in surprise, but instantly
understood. She slipped her hand into the
mother’s and softly asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“Was it long ago?”</p>

<p>“Five years. She would have almost been a
woman now and I often think what she would
have been to me as such. Then I look abroad
and am glad she is not here to suffer the intolerable
loneliness of the plains. The young are
not fond of solitude. Her name was Mary.”</p>

<p>“Why, my own mother’s name! I’m glad of
that. Maybe she wouldn’t have suffered.
Anyway, you know she doesn’t now. My father
says that though our mother was so very, very
happy on this earth, she is far happier now,
with God.”</p>

<p>“Dear little comforter, so I try to believe of
my own daughter,” said the woman, laying her
hand on Carlota’s head.</p>

<p>“Was that her cactus?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She set it here. Her father planted
the tree, which a brakeman brought her from a
distant station. There were other things here,
too, but they are gone. At first, I felt too desolate
to care for them, and, when I had rallied
so that I could, it was too late. Yet since it
was here that she had made her garden it was
here I had her put to rest.”</p>

<p>Carlota looked curiously at the stones.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Away off in the distance, also, she could see beside
the track another of the dead cattle which
had so frightened her while on the hand-car.
Mrs. Burnham noticed the glance and answered
it:</p>

<p>“We had to put the tule reeds as a precaution
against the coyotes.”</p>

<p>The girl shivered and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“How dreadful! Yet the stones don’t make
any difference. The dear God knows about her,
just the same. And—and—the cactus is very
beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, yes. ‘The cactus is very beautiful.’
There is no life so dark or barren but may
have its cactus bloom. Now since you have told
me all about yourself I’ll tell you what is needful
you should know about this Burnham family.
It will do for the ‘story’ that Teddy is
always begging.”</p>

<p>She smiled upon the little man who now approached,
with his fat hands full of a rare yellow
blossom which he offered to Carlota.</p>

<p>“Posies, girl, for you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, <i>niño</i>. You’re a darling, darling
baby! I do love flowers better than—than
almost anything, I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>Teddy climbed up beside her and watched as,
almost unconsciously, she began to pull one of
the strange blooms to pieces.</p>

<p>“Girl! No, no! You mustn’t bweak them.
It might hurt them, my muvver says.”</p>

<p>“I’m not hurting it, Teddy. See? Little by
little, I take it apart, gently, for I’m trying to
find out its name. Though, maybe, Señora, you
know it?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ve not seen them often. But—at
your age—do you understand botany?”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand it—much. Only, most
always, if I have a new plant I can find its class
and, often, its genus. Like this. Don’t you
know?”</p>

<p>“Once I knew. I was a teacher in my girlhood.”
The sight of the child analyzing the
desert flower had carried the exile’s thoughts
back over many years, to a pleasant New England
schoolroom and a class of eager maidens
who learned from her. Yet she promptly banished
her momentary regret, reflecting: “The
cactus is very beautiful! And my blessings
do outnumber my deprivations.”</p>

<p>It was a wonderfully skillful young hand
which dissected the unknown flower and, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
it lay with all its parts separated and arranged,
Mrs. Burnham’s interest was as great as Teddy’s.
Eager to see, he thrust his dark head between
Carlota and her “subject” in a way that
hindered her study, so she left its finishing until
another time.</p>

<p>“I’ll put the rest of the blossoms in my box,
Teddy, but I’m quite sure it’s an orchid. I
think it is a ‘Plantanthera.’ I do miss my
father so about flowers. He knows everything
and everyone there is, I s’pose.”</p>

<p>“I thought that looked like a ‘botany-box,’
when I saw Dennis take it off the car, last night.
Yet, I could hardly believe I saw one—here.”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes. We always take our things. Carlos
has his hammer. My father teached him,
taught him, I mean, about stones, ’cause he
doesn’t care so much for flowers. Now, please
tell me the story. I love stories as well as
Teddy, prob’ly. Old Marta knows heaps of
them but Guadalupo knows even more. Beg
pardon. I’ll stop talking and listen.”</p>

<p>Yet Mrs. Burnham hesitated a little, trying
to decide how much it was necessary Carlota
should know; though impelled by the girl’s
abounding sympathy to talk freely of matters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
usually kept to herself. Carlota helped her,
laughingly:</p>

<p>“I know. When I want to tell a story and
the words don’t come right away I always begin:
‘Once upon a time’.”</p>

<p>The lady smiled, took a fresh needleful of
thread, turned the stocking she was darning,
and began:</p>

<p>“Well, ‘once upon a time,’ my husband’s
father died, very suddenly, leaving behind him a
large debt to a rich woman from whom he had
borrowed money to carry on his business—that
failed. His two children, Teddy’s father and
his Aunt Ella, determined to pay this debt and
clear their father’s name and honor. She became
a trained nurse and is now in a New York
hospital. She has a fine position and good salary
and is steadily putting aside part of it, toward
her share of the debt. But she works
very, very hard and it is a fresh trouble to Mr.
Burnham that he isn’t able to provide for himself.
He came west to engage in mining, and
has made several ventures in that line. Until
now none of them have turned out as he hoped,
so he took this position till he saw his way to a
fresh start. He thinks he sees now the way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
leave here very soon. I hope that before we
go your friends will have come for you. If not,
you may have to be left with other strangers,
and I thought best to prepare you; and you understand,
now, why I wish you to keep all of
your belongings together. But—that’s all.
If you could so soon become to me like one of my
own, why shouldn’t you to another just as
easily.”</p>

<p>It was like Carlota to think first of others,
nor had she fully realized the result to herself
if her new friends departed before she was
“called for.” The word “mining” had roused
familiar ideas and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh! I do wish my father was here to see
about Mr. Burnham’s mine! He would know
in a minute if it was a good one!”</p>

<p>“But, deary, we have no mine—yet, nor the
slightest interest in one. We are merely ‘prospecting’—”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon. Oh, that’s what my father
does!”</p>

<p>“Has he a mine of his own?” asked the settler’s
wife, with almost pitiful eagerness.</p>

<p>“No, indeed! He doesn’t wish one. It’s
just his business to—to location them. I’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
better ask Carlos, or you would. He knows
more about it than I do.”</p>

<p>Then, as the rumble of an approaching train
startled her, she sprang up and frantically
waved her hand to Carlos and Jack, who were
hunting gophers on the plain beyond the track.</p>

<p>“Oh! they’ll be rolled on and killed! The
train—the cars—my brother!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham rose and took the little girl’s
hand.</p>

<p>“There, there, child! No trains can hurt you
or anybody if you keep away from the rails.
Try to look upon them as the pleasantest things
of our days, and you’ll soon get over your fear.
Now, you and Teddy play by yourselves. I see
that Mr. Burnham wishes to speak with me, before
this train arrives.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>A ROUGH KNIGHT ERRANT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Letitia, that woman we owe was on the
train that stopped here last night. She was
one of those who spoke to these Manuel children
and the sight of her clinched my anxiety
to get away.”</p>

<p>“That—woman? Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“I reckon I can’t be mistaken in the face of
the person who has held a mortgage on my life
so long. The queer thing is, I overheard her
say she’d ‘crossed the continent a dozen times’—that
I never chanced to see her before. Now—shall
I send word ahead that the new man
can have my place?”</p>

<p>“So—soon, dear?”</p>

<p>“Capable operators and agents aren’t as
thick as sage brush hereabouts. Especially
those willing to live at—Tuttle! I owe something
to the company I’ve served so long and—I
mustn’t lose this chance. The traces I found—I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
sure this venture’ll pan out well—I hate
to uproot you from your home, poor as it is,
but I hope to give you a better. Shall I send
word, ‘Yes?’ Here she comes!”</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” faltered the wife, hurriedly turning
houseward to hide the tears which had started
to her eyes. To leave the home itself was less
to her than leaving the stone-covered grave beside
it. However, frail as she was, she was a
loyal wife and sunshiny woman, and she made
the best of the matter. She would at once begin
her preparations, but her heart was heavy
with forebodings concerning the children so unexpectedly
placed in her care.</p>

<p>Mr. Burnham had lost no time in carrying out
the suggestions of Captain Sherman’s note.
He had sat up late on the night of its arrival
dispatching and receiving messages concerning
them. He had even supplemented the cavalryman’s
directions by inquiries of his own,
for when all was summed up that officer’s facts
had been meager, indeed.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Burnham thought, it was fortunate
that the new station-master could not arrive at
Tuttle till the end of two weeks; and during
those fourteen days her husband made fresh efforts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
to trace the children’s friends, anxiously
scanning every mail and listening to every wire—and
all without result.</p>

<p>What had seemed to Captain Sherman and,
at first, even to Mr. Burnham, the simplest matter
in the world became impossible to accomplish;
and all because of a chain of circumstances,
each trivial in itself.</p>

<p>The letters and messages sent to Lanark, the
nearest postoffice to Refugio, remained unclaimed
and undelivered, because on the very
night of Pablo’s arrival at the mission, Miguel
had left it and had not returned. Nobody else
there sent to Lanark, nor did the indolent mail-and-telegraph-agent
trouble to forward any
matter to Refugio, since he knew that both its
master and manager were absent.</p>

<p>When he left home after failing to draw further
information from Pablo than the agave leaf
contained, Miguel set off at once on a search
of his own; and by a strange chance came to
that glen in the mountains where Benoni lay
dead among the dead Apaches. Always hasty
in judgment, the distracted fellow now leaped
to the conclusion that his beloved “small ones”
were also dead—or worse—were in captivity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
and that thereafter life held only torment for
him. He would never dare to look upon Adrian
Manuel’s face again; and, though he still carried
the sealed letter which was to be opened
at the end of two months, he resolved to go
where none could find him till that time came.
Then—“what shall be will be!” he concluded,
and mounting the horse which supplied Amador’s
place, he rode away southward and was
seen no more.</p>

<p>The Disbrows, also, left at once, and reached
a remote little town on their homeward way,
when the elder gentleman was suddenly stricken
with a serious illness. Indeed he was so extremely
ill that, Mr. Rupert, who would otherwise
have been eager to secure and read all
newspapers, had neither time nor thought for
anything save nursing his father back to health,
or, at least, to a physical condition fit for travel.
He did, however, seize an opportunity to dispatch
a message to Mrs. Sinclair; confident that
her energy would be sufficient to trace her
“Mary’s children,” should they still be alive.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Sinclair was at that time on her
journey across the continent, and the servant
left in charge of her home received the message<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
and mislaid it. She had not dared to break the
seal and read it, or she might have told it
promptly on her mistress’s arrival. As it was,
fearing the sharp rebukes which would have
been given her, she kept the matter secret,
trusting in her heart that “it couldn’t have
amounted to anything or another would have
followed.”</p>

<p>Adrian Manuel, the longed for father, lay a
prisoner between hospital walls, and in imminent
danger of never leaving them alive. He
was so critically ill that he was oblivious to all
that went on about him, nor were the advertising
columns of a newspaper of any interest to
the quiet nurse who attended him; and who, because
of his hazardous condition, allowed no
less experienced person to care for him.</p>

<p>This was the reason of his mysterious journey
“to the north.” The knowledge of his serious
malady had come to him with startling suddenness
and he had made instant preparation
to place himself under the best surgical treatment.
He would not sadden his happy little
ones by his own forebodings and had ridden
bravely away with a gay “<i>Adios!</i>” to meet his
fate. Should he not return, the sealed letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
provided for everything, and especially, that the
twins were then to be taken to Mrs. Sinclair,
who thus would be left their natural and only
guardian.</p>

<p>So, when the two weeks expired and the Burnhams
could no longer delay departure they decided
that the young Manuels must accompany
them. The new station-master was a rough old
miner, unmarried, and though efficient in the
duties he assumed, he liked to keep a lot of such
men as himself about him. To leave Carlota
in such an establishment, even on the now fading
chance of her father’s claiming her, seemed
impossible to Mrs. Burnham.</p>

<p>But the child, herself, strenuously protested
against this departure. Captain Sherman’s
lecture upon “Obedience” had vividly impressed
her.</p>

<p>“He said to stay was right. I’d made trouble
enough not obediencing before and I must. He
was a soldier—he knew. We must not go away
from this straight railroad track, not at all.
We can live at Leopard with Dennis, if we can’t
live with the new folks.”</p>

<p>Whereat that fine fellow answered without
delay:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Sure, me purty colleen, ’tis meself ’d be
proud to have the carin’ of ye, so it would.
More by token ye’re a born lady, so ye be. But,
faith, if the family’s going to dig gold out of
the mountains beyant, Dennis Fogarty’s the
man must have a fist in that same. Och! It’s
the truth I am speakin’.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burnham clinched the argument, saying:</p>

<p>“That cuts your last plank from under you,
my dear. Never mind. I shall leave directions
what is to be done when you are sent for and
how we may be followed. We start to-morrow
morning, at sunrise.”</p>

<p>At the hour they named they did so. A canvas-covered
wagon containing a camper’s outfit
and drawn by four old—therefore experienced—horses,
left the little station platform
for a “Castle in Spain.” Yet, despite Letitia
Burnham’s feeling that it might prove only that,
she was cheerful over the departure, seeing her
husband happy at resuming what he called “the
business of his life,” and that he now believed
would be successful. He had often, on similar
settings-out, been equally sanguine, but the good
wife was not one to remind him of that. Besides,
as she confided to Carlota:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“After all’s said and done, away down in
their hearts all human beings love a little vagabondizing!”</p>

<p>So, though her eyes filled as she glanced toward
her Mary’s grave she was still able to
smile upon Teddy, lifting him into the wagon
and, rather hastily, climbing in beside him.</p>

<p>“I think it will be lovely, even though it
doesn’t seem right for us—Carlos and me.
But we shall like it. We’re used to sleeping
out of doors and it will be like a long, all-summer
picnic, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“I hope so. Of course, there will be hard
realities. The worst is sometimes wanting
water. It’s a thirsty, thirsty land, this New
Mexico. But—‘The Lord will provide’.”</p>

<p>Carlota ran on in front and joined her
brother and his comrade, Jack; and, presently,
to their surprise there came to them the sound
of Letitia Burnham—singing! A low, sweet
hymn, whose burden was thanksgiving.</p>

<p>“Gophers! The mother at that business?
Hold on! Hark!” cried Jack, who could
scarcely believe his own ears.</p>

<p>“Your father is singing with her. That’s
all,” said Carlota.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“That’s all, is it? ‘All?’ Well, then, Saynyereeter,
let me tell you that I, John Winterbottom
Burnham, can’t remember that, during the
whole course of my checkered career, I ever
heard my respected respectable parents warble
before!”</p>

<p>“You—disrespectful boy!”</p>

<p>“What have I done now? Can’t a fellow call
attention to the talents of his parents without
being accused of disrespect?” he demanded, in
affected astonishment.</p>

<p>They all laughed. They were in a mood to
find even trifles amusing. There was not a
cloud in that wonderful sky; the blue was almost
too radiantly deep. There was a clearness
in the air which rendered the distant
mountains closely visible, and the expanse
which lay between them and these hills of delight
seemed less a solitude than did that central
plain, marked by its one line of shining
steel.</p>

<p>“Behold, my friends! We go out—paupers;
we return—millionaires!” declared Jack,
proudly strutting beside his “team.” These
four venerable “campaigners,” who had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
chosen because of their familiarity with plain
and mountain life, were the first horses with
which he had ever been familiar. The days of
his parents’ former wanderings a-field had been
too early for him to recall.</p>

<p>“Hmm. That front beast on the left has a
spavin,” remarked Carlos, musingly.</p>

<p>“Huh! What’s that? Spavin! Spavin!
I’d have you understand, young Trot-and-go-barefoot,
you—that what I don’t know about
horseflesh isn’t worth knowing.”</p>

<p>Carlos looked on, questioningly. He rarely
knew whether Jack were jesting or in earnest;
but, either way, he found that having a boy
companion was so delightful that he was inclined
to rather neglect Carlota, with whom his
time had always been passed. At that same
moment, up came Dennis, riding a vicious little
beast which was doing its utmost to unseat the
unaccustomed horseman.</p>

<p>“Dennis! Dennis, on a broncho!” cried
young Burnham, stopping his leader’s progress,
to await this fresh arrival. “We
thought you had petered out, Dennis, me
friend! Sickened of the job and gone back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
straightening the ties. Where did you get
that nag, eh? and what are you doing with that
unhappy burro?”</p>

<p>“Whoa, I tell ye! Whist! to the heels of ye!
So, so. Yes, I know, I know. There, there!
Quiet, me beautiful boy! So, so—so-o!”</p>

<p>The wild little horse had been nearly maddened
by the treatment of its new owner. It
had been checked up till its neck was half-twisted
out of shape, while a facetious trackman
had persuaded Dennis to put on spurs of
an exaggerated size.</p>

<p>As soon as the broncho neared the other
horses it quieted its movements and, as if to
give the children a chance to contemplate its
rider in all his glory, planted its forefeet firmly
in the sand and stood stock-still.</p>

<p>“Och! Dennis, me boy! Sure ’tis yourself
that’s magnificent, entirely!” mocked Jack,
clapping his hands to his breast with a tragic
air.</p>

<p>Nor, though they tried, could the twins help
laughing.</p>

<p>“If Miguel could see!” cried Carlos, hurrying
forward to examine the Irishman’s outfit.</p>

<p>This was truly gorgeous. He had purchased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
it from a passing Mexican <i>vaquero</i>. It consisted
of much adorned, leathern breeches; a
gay silk shirt and sash; a fine <i>serape</i> (cloak),
thrown carelessly over one shoulder; a handsome
<i>sombrero</i>; long boots, such as no Mexican
would have parted with, save from dire necessity;
a heavy, clumsy saddle; and a bridle, rich
in ornament. Altogether, a fine and picturesque
outfit, that might serve well in some
<i>fiesta</i> procession, but likely to prove troublesome
on the present trip.</p>

<p>Carlota soon stopped laughing. Even
though she could see in the depths of the
“schooner” the amused faces of Mr. and Mrs.
Burnham, she feared that Dennis might be
more sensitive than he appeared and he, certainly,
had spared nothing to do justice to the
occasion.</p>

<p>“It surely is a nice little pony, Dennis. But
I’ve only seen you walking the track or on a
hand-car and I didn’t know you were a horseman;”
she remarked.</p>

<p>“Faith, it wouldn’t be much of a man that
couldn’t bestride the back of a beast, now
would it, little lady? It’s ridin’ I haven’t been
doin’, belike, but that’s neither here nor there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
It’s ridin’ I shall be from this on, and why not?
But, how do ye like me new clothes, Miss Carlota?”</p>

<p>“They are very grand, Dennis. I’ve seen
such at <i>fiestas</i>, yet, on ordinary days they’ve
been put away very carefully. I hope you
won’t hurt them in the mountains. Why, your
<i>sombrero</i> is finer than mine, and much more
adorned.”</p>

<p>“Sure it is that, now ain’t it?” said Dennis,
well pleased. “But ye’re not askin’ a word
about t’other fine beast I’m a leadin’, me
dear.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that is for your—your—pack,
isn’t it. Or to rest you and the broncho when
he is tired.”</p>

<p>Now, indeed, was Dennis Fogarty a happy
man! Almost from the first he had become
Carlota’s slave, and the Burnhams were glad of
it, for he added to her enjoyment. They suspected
that he had for her sake decided to go
mining; and, also, for her sake, had Carlota
known it, that he had expended his dollars in
the purchase of this decorative outfit.</p>

<p>“Sure, little lady, is it only that deceivin’
Meegell (Miguel) that can wear the handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
contraptions, belike? ’Twas meself an’ Mickey
Grady as thought the matther out. A <i>sombrero</i>
is it? What then? So have I. Sayrappy?
Faith, I warrant here’s one to be proud of.
And a burro, says you? Now how’d this purty
grayish-whitey be pleasin’ yerself? Eh, me
little lady?”</p>

<p>Even yet Carlota did not comprehend what
Dennis thought he had made so plain.</p>

<p>“He’s a pretty little creature. Indeed, he
is much like one I used to have at home. Carlos
had one all beautifully marked with brown
and white, but mine was just a mouse-colored
dear, as like this one as—as one star is like
another. You have made a good choice, I think,
Dennis.”</p>

<p>Then was the Irishman’s felicity complete.
He slipped from his broncho and bowing low
before his “little lady,” offered her the leading
strap of the “mouse-colored dear.”</p>

<p>“Then sure, Miss Carlota, ye’ll be doin’ me
that proud by acceptin’ this same, as a token o’
friendship, belike. And I’d admire to be seein’
how ye fits on his back.”</p>

<p>“For—me? You have bought that pretty
creature for me? Why, Dennis, Dennis!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“That same is me name, an’ no shame to it;
barrin’ ye’ll have none of the beast.”</p>

<p>“But, I’ll have all of him, indeed! Oh!
thank you, thank you!”</p>

<p>Her delight and the way in which she clapped
her little brown hands nearly turned the brain
of the generous Irishman. Hitherto, he had
known but hard toil and the rough side of life,
but Carlota represented to him something
wholly different; and the chivalry which is latent
in every manly breast, no matter how humble,
roused him to become her champion and
protector. Moreover, he was very jealous of
the unknown Miguel, of whom both children
talked with such sincere affection. To Mike
Grady, alone, had Dennis confided his ambition:</p>

<p>“I’ll take the shine off that ‘Greaser’ or I’ll
spend the last cent I ever will earn. Mind that,
now;” and, after he had arrayed himself in his
finery, he had asked: “Do ye think, Mickey
boy, that the ‘Greaser’ ’ll look grander nor me,
the day?”</p>

<p>Faithful to friendship as to wrestling, Mike
had replied and meant it:</p>

<p>“Sure, there never was man under sun so fine
as yourself the morn, Dennis, me lad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>Carlota felt really touched and grateful as
she cried:</p>

<p>“All gray, with that pretty white blaze on
his face! What is his name, dear Dennis?”</p>

<p>“Name is it? If he has one, ’tis more nor I
know. Let me lift ye on, please.”</p>

<p>She could easily have stepped into the low
saddle, but she recognized that he wished to
“swing her up,” as Miguel used to do upon
some of the spirited horses at Refugio; so she
let him lift her, all clumsily and delightedly,
and settled herself in her place with a laugh of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“He’s lovely! He shall be called Connemara,
for your home. It’s a pretty long name
for a pretty small beast, but what he lacks in
size he makes up in his cog-cognomen. That’s
right, I think.”</p>

<p>It was entirely right to the happy donor.</p>

<p>“Connemara, says she. Hear to it, all.
Connemara, for me own purty home. Sure it’s
proud am I—”</p>

<p>A shriek—a chorus of voices broke in upon
his happiness:</p>

<p>“Dennis! Dennis! The broncho! The—bronch—is—gone!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>HAPPENINGS BY THE WAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Presentation civilities were cut short. Dennis
wheeled round, then became motionless.
For a moment he had left his new horse to its
own self, carelessly dropping the bridle, as he
slipped off its back—a fact none observed save
the broncho himself. He did; and when a fitting
moment arrived he flung up his heels and
was off, over the plain.</p>

<p>For poor Dennis it was a swift and bitter
descent from the height of joy to the depth of
woe. His grief was almost tragic, and Mr.
Burnham had to look away from the face under
the <i>sombrero</i>, it was so wholly Irish and un-Mexican.</p>

<p>“Me horse! Me horse! Och! But I’m undone.
Sure, ’tis not I can walk all the way to
them mountains beyant. Me horse! Me
horse!”</p>

<p>“Dennis dear, you shall have the burro back.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
Don’t you worry about walking. Though I’m
sorry the broncho ran away,” said Carlota
soothingly, and slipped from “Connemara” before
the other could prevent.</p>

<p>“Burro—be bothered!”</p>

<p>“Why—Dennis!”</p>

<p>“Beggin’ yer pardon, me dear; but after all
the money I’ve spent on the beast. Ochone!
Arrah musha, the day!”</p>

<p>The trackman was grievously disappointed.
Of what use his fine attire if he must return to
walking the rails? As for going to the mines,
unmounted, he would never do that; and he
would travel barefoot anywhere rather than
take the gift he had made.</p>

<p>“Connemara, is it? His legs is too short an’
mine is too long. They’d drag on the ground,
so they would.”</p>

<p>Carlota ceased to argue the matter. Her attention
and that of the others had been called
to Carlos who, upon the broncho’s flight, had
not wasted breath upon anybody but had set off
in instant pursuit. “As swift as an arrow.”
He had been trained by an Indian and could run
like one. As he sped over it, his moccasined
feet scarcely touched the ground, and his lithe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
body seemed poised as lightly as a bird’s in its
flight. As he ran his sister cried exultantly:</p>

<p>“See Carlos! Oh! see Carlos! He’ll catch
him! He will—he will!”</p>

<p>She clapped her hands, lustily. Her eyes
shone and her cheeks flushed. It was impossible
to look at her and not share her enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Oh! I haven’t seen him run like that since
the last Easter <i>fiesta</i>. Then there were such
races! But he won them nearly all. My father
says there can be no muscles better trained than
my brother’s, if he cares to exerter—exercise—them.
See! See! He has his <i>riata</i>.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He
will throw it. He gains—he gains!”</p>

<p>He might have succeeded in any case but this
particular broncho was less swift than vicious.
Also, he was burdened by a lot of useless trappings,
which irritated and hindered him, and
this was in Carlos’s favor.</p>

<p>The whole cavalcade had stopped when Dennis
rode up to join it, but Mr. Burnham now directed
Jack to go forward.</p>

<p>“Keep to the road, son, in the way the runaway
took. I meant to go straight north, toward
that first range, but this affair alters our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
course for the present. Dennis, if you’re tired,
climb in here with us; or ride one of the team,
as you choose.”</p>

<p>“Sure, ’tis neither ridin’ nor drivin’ I’ll be
doin’ the now. Hold! I declare that’s the
smartest cleverest one in the world! See!
See the speed of him! He’s winnin’—he’s
winnin’, the little gossoon!”</p>

<p>The Irishman was again radiant. A contest
of any sort was “victuals an’ drink” to him.
He made Carlota remount Connemara, and
marched along beside her, “as stiff as he was
stout,” yet growing more and more excited.</p>

<p>“The <i>riata</i>! The <i>riata</i>! How glad I am he
took it, and he had nothing else except his own
nimble feet!” cried Carlota, in pride at the
prowess of her twin.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, I know. He wasn’t like some,
so he wasn’t, more boast nor boost,” rejoined
Dennis, casting a disdainful glance upon Jack,
who was booted and spurred in a manner only
second to his own, though the lad’s regalia
was extremely “second-hand” and had mostly
been acquired by methods which would have
greatly displeased his parents.</p>

<p>At this, Carlota turned her gaze from her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
brother to Jack, with that surprised expression
that always disconcerted him, and, for the first
time, fully observed his attire. Then she demanded:</p>

<p>“Why, boy, what are you going to fight? A
bowie knife—a pair of rusty pistols—a gun!
How an Apache, or a wild cat, would run if he
saw you! But look! Carlos has caught the
broncho—he surely has!”</p>

<p>This was so, and attention now centered upon
the approaching victor of the race.</p>

<p>“A lad is swifter than a horse!” cried the
sister, waving her <i>sombrero</i> in congratulation
to her brother.</p>

<p>They speedily met and, leaping down from
the now subdued animal, Carlos handed the bridle
to Dennis, saying:</p>

<p>“There, good friend! That saves your walking.”</p>

<p>“Thanks to ye, me boy! Sure, you’re the
slick smartest one ever lived. You’re quite fit
to be brother to your sister, so ye be, an’ that’s
more’n I could say for aught other young body
I know,” with another meaning glance in Jack’s
direction.</p>

<p>But, just then, that youth had no attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
for the trackman. He was curiously examining
Carlos’s <i>riata</i>. He had always aspired to
be a cowboy, and believed that a first step toward
this exalted state would be by the use of a
lasso. So he asked:</p>

<p>“Will you show me that trick, Carlos? Do it
and I’ll give you one of my ‘irons;’ and if
you’ll sell me the lariat I’ll give you my jack-knife.”</p>

<p>Carlos had never heard of “swapping.”
Rather surprised, he looked up and promptly
replied:</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll show you—if I can. It’s not
much to do. You just throw it, you know, and
it does the rest of the work.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see. It’s easy, real easy. I could
do it myself if I wanted to. I just thought,
maybe, you’d like to show me. Might make
you feel as if—as if—” Jack stammered and
stopped. He had been ready to add: “as if you
were of some use in our family;” but reflected
that the remark would have offended his hospitable
parents.</p>

<p>“As if what?” asked Carlos, when Jack hesitated,
confused.</p>

<p>“Oh! nothing. If you don’t want to you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
needn’t, Mr. Throw-a-rope. I can trade with
some other fellow. Likely we’ll meet a cowboy
before night, anyway.”</p>

<p>Carlos laughed.</p>

<p>“His lasso is the last thing any cowboy will
part with. It is his most useful possession and
he often spends large sums of money on it. A
<i>vaquero</i> gave my father one that is worth—Oh!
a fabulous price. We keep it in a place of
honor in the hall, for it’s made of the finest
horsehair from thoroughbred stock, and has
bands of silver where the lengths are joined,
every little way. It is beautiful, and so slender
you can hold it all in your palms.”</p>

<p>“You won’t swap this, then?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t. It was a gift and nobody sells a
gift, but you may use it all you wish.”</p>

<p>“How can I, if you carry it all the time?”</p>

<p>“Sure enough! But wait. Some time, soon,
I’ll tell you why I can’t let you have it just yet—even
as a loan.”</p>

<p>Dennis was now on the broncho’s back, and
Carlos ran alongside to give the inexperienced
horseman a few hints that were useful.</p>

<p>“Sure, an’ I s’pose you’ve always been a-horseback,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> 
me boy?” asked the grateful and
admiring fellow.</p>

<p>“Nearly. I’ve never walked when I could
ride, and when I’ve walked I’ve always run!
So that’s an Irish speech for you, Dennis.”</p>

<p>“Carlos shall ride Connemara quite half the
time,” said Carlota, who had joined them and
who felt sorry that her brother was not, also,
mounted.</p>

<p>“Ride a burro? After Benoni? Well, no,
indeed! Burros are nice for girls, though even
you, Carlota—”</p>

<p>He paused as she warningly shook her head
but Dennis had no attention for anything except
his broncho and was himself getting on
very well. His pride in his skill and his accoutrements
increased and the twins dropped
behind to have a little “talk.”</p>

<p>Carlota had noticed a look on her brother’s
face that she did not like and promptly asked:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Carlos dear?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“You are unhappy. Tell me, darling.”</p>

<p>“It’s that boy, Jack. He makes me feel—feel—he’s
so boastful over those old pack-horses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> 
that we’d turn out in the field to die at
home, Carlota?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p>“Everybody but me is mounted.”</p>

<p>“You may have the whole of Connemara.
I’ll ride in the big ‘schooner’.”</p>

<p>“I want you not to tell anybody—any single
person—but I’m going to get myself a horse, a
beauty!”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to catch a wild horse from a herd
I saw. But don’t say one word to the others
till I come riding up on its back. I’ll lag behind
now and nobody will notice when I slip
over the plain.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I hate to have you go! There’s nobody
here who is my very own except you, Carlos,
heart of my life.”</p>

<p>“But I’m coming back—in an hour or two.”</p>

<p>“My father went away. Are you going to
the ‘north’ as he did, brother?”</p>

<p>“A little way ‘north,’ and you’re to tell nobody
till I come riding back on a new Benoni.
Now, <i>Adios, niña</i>!<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Watch out for me—thus!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>He waved his arms above his head, kissed his
finger tips to her as Miguel would have done,
and darted northward. She watched him
through her tears and with a sinking heart, yet
tried to remember his promise: “In an hour or
two.” Then she rejoined the others and kept
a faithful “watch out” all that long day; but
even when the sun went down her brother had
not returned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>THE SIEGE OF CORK</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Even the possession of his broncho could not
long fill the mind of Dennis to the exclusion of
his “little lady.” Having missed her from the
party in advance of the wagon he halted and let
that pass, then retraced his way to where she
was slowly approaching, alone.</p>

<p>“Sure, Miss Carlota, this is the botherin’
beast! If I wants him to go forard it’s backard
he will; an’ if backard—then forard’s the
word. What would ye be doin’ to him if he
was yours, if ye please?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I never ‘broke’ a horse,
though I’ve often seen others do it. Miguel
says that either a man or his horse must be
master and that there’s no peace till it’s settled.
He believes in making a final thing of it, once
for all.”</p>

<p>“Faith, I’m not thinkin’ I’d like the
‘Greaser’ overmuch but, all the same, a body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
must give—um, um—his due. I’ll have to tussle
the thing out, bime-by, I trow.”</p>

<p>Then he looked at her wondering to see traces
of tears on her face. Pulling the forelock
which dangled below his sombrero, he asked:</p>

<p>“An’ who’s been makin’ ye cry, this fine
mornin’, Miss Carlota?”</p>

<p>“Nobody. Nobody, at all. It was foolish,
but see? I am not now,” and she smiled into
his troubled face.</p>

<p>“But where is the little gossoon, me dear?
Sure, I’ve a mind to go halves with him in this
creatur’ o’ mine. That boy Jack, beyant, who
doesn’t know horse from mule nor t’other from
which, is so set up an’ flairboyant, I must take
him down a peg. Never mind, says I to myself.
Wait a bit, Dennis, me boy, says I. ’Tis a half
of a horse master Carlos shall have now, but
a whole one bime-by.”</p>

<p>“Why, Dennis! What do you mean? How
do you know? I thought it was to be a surprise!”
cried Carlota.</p>

<p>“Sure, an isn’t it? We’ll speak never a
word, you an’ me, till we meets up with a beast
what wants to be sellin’ himself an’ then—out
goes the wind from Jack’s sails—kerflump!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“Oh! is that all? I thought you meant something
different;” and she smiled again, anticipating
the moment when Carlos should return,
riding a beautiful animal which had cost him
nothing but his own prowess. “But, Dennis,
what is your broncho’s name!”</p>

<p>“Name, says you? Humph! That’s more
nor I know meself. But, bein’s he’s a new
master why not a new name? Eh? An’ is it
yourself will be doin’ the honor to speak it?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I thank you, but I couldn’t. I’ve
named one animal already to-day and I may
have to name another—I mean—I’d rather you
did it yourself. Dennis, though it was kind of
you to think I might. What shall it be?”</p>

<p>“Belike—it may not be—anything! Whoa,
there! Whoa, I tell ye!”</p>

<p>“You’re pulling too tight on that bridle.
Maybe, he thinks you want him to stand on his
head—drawing him like that! Oh, Dennis,
Dennis! Don’t. Do take it easily. Your fingers
are clinched and your teeth set as if you
were in terror. That’s not the way to ride, no,
no; and I’ve told you once, already.”</p>

<p>“What then? What’s ‘once’ to a stupid like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
me? Ain’t this the right grip o’ the thing—so?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! You should see Miguel. His
touch is like a feather on the rein yet—so firm!
Amador would neither disobey him nor obey
anybody else. See. This way. Don’t squeeze
your hand so tight. You look, Dennis, you do
look as if you were in—agony!”</p>

<p>The poor fellow was. He would a thousand
times rather have been striding along upon his
own stout feet than riding that uncomfortable
thing. The saddle had become a throne of torment.
His great boots seemed like lead. His
hat flopped in his eyes, his buckskin jacket gave
him a vapor bath, and his spurs got into the
wrong places, goading rather than guiding the
broncho.</p>

<p>Carlota suggested:</p>

<p>“S’pose we wait and rest a bit, and I’ll give
you another lesson. Good. First, now name
him. Then we’ll talk to him by his name till he
learns it, and finds that new, better behavior is
expected of him.”</p>

<p>“All right, me little lady. That there Meegell
rests now an’ again, I s’pose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“Surely. Did you think that he rode all the
time?”</p>

<p>Dennis had so thought. The vivid picture in
his imagination was of a dark and handsome
horseman sitting upright in his saddle and careering
at breakneck speed over hill and plain.</p>

<p>“The name, Dennis. Let’s stick to that,
first.”</p>

<p>“Acushla! What says you to—Cork?”</p>

<p>“Cork! Cork? Is he a cork? Beg pardon,
but I don’t quite understand.”</p>

<p>Somewhat nettled, the Irishman responded:</p>

<p>“Faith, ’tis simple, thinks I. If Connemara,
what’s a town, is a good name for a no-account
creatur’ of a burro, can’t Cork, what’s a city,
be right for a horse? Eh? A city’s finer nor
a town an’ a horse nor a donkey, says I.”</p>

<p>“That seems sensible. Cork isn’t as musically,
I mean musical, as Connemara, and your
broncho isn’t as pretty a beast. But it’s short
and easy to say when you get—angry—so often,
poor Dennis!”</p>

<p>“Who-a-a, there! Stand still. Be easy,
easy, lad! Cork—Cor—rk, C-O-R-K!!”</p>

<p>Carlota backed away and gave the broncho
and his master a wide space. She was half-frightened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span> 
half-amused, for matters between
them had, evidently, reached a crisis. The animal
upraised, and so suddenly, that Dennis was
unseated and slipped down over its back in a
manner neither flattering to his vanity nor helpful
to his temper. Then, from somewhere
about his person, he produced a short, stout
stick, with which he belabored the equally furious
beast as if death were the object at which
he aimed.</p>

<p>“Oh! you cruel, cruel man! He’ll kill you—or
you him! Dennis—Cork! Oh! Dennis,
Dennis!” screamed Carlota, lustily.</p>

<p>The wagon, now some distance in front, came
to a halt, for the girl’s cries had reached and
startled its occupants, so that Mr. Burnham
and Jack ran back to see what caused the uproar.
Yet, at that critical moment, even they
dared not interfere. They ranged themselves
beside Carlota and silently watched the strange
contest.</p>

<p>“If ’tis a fight ye be wantin’ ’tis a fight ye
shall have!” yelled the trackman, now indifferent
to everything save the rebellious beast for
which he had spent his hardly earned dollars.
His blood was up, his spirits rose. “Sure, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
thought me daily exercise was gone entirely,
seein’ I’d left me friend Mickey behind. Come
on, then, I’m the man for ye!” he panted.</p>

<p>The battle which ensued was against all rules
of horse training and more in the line of warfare
to which the Irishman was accustomed;
but, even in the fiercest of the mêlée Dennis retained
a firm hold upon the bridle rein. Because
of carelessness, he would never again lose
his precious broncho. The spectators beheld a
dangerous mixture of legs, heads, and hoofs;
heard the continued whack, whack, of the shillalah,
and anticipated mortal hurt to the ignorant
trackman. Then—the mustang lay prone
upon the ground and Dennis stood above it—master!</p>

<p>“Faith, that settles it! From this on, Fogarty’s
boss!”</p>

<p>“O, Dennis! You’ve hurt him cruelly, cruelly,
I’m afraid!” said Carlota, slipping off her
burro to kneel beside the prostrate brute and
tenderly pat his head.</p>

<p>For the conqueror, she had no word of compassion,
though he looked much the worse of
the two. His fine attire was torn and dust-covered,
his face scratched and bleeding, one of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
gigantic spurs broken, and his gay sash in ribbons.
Yet there was an expression of supreme
content upon his features and his labor-bowed
shoulders held themselves with a new and martial
bearing.</p>

<p>“‘See, the conquering hero comes!’” mocked
Jack, and waved his hat ecstatically.</p>

<p>Not a muscle of Dennis moved. Rigidly
grand and imperturbable, he stood a monument
for all to see. When sufficient silence was obtained
for the full effect of his superiority he
commanded, with great dignity:</p>

<p>“Cork, get up!”</p>

<p>The animal glanced at the man who stood
above him; then, meekly as any burro might,
the forever-tamed broncho staggered to its feet.
With a look toward the still kneeling Carlota,
which asked as plain as speech—“Could your
Meegell beat that?” Mr. Fogarty slipped the
bridle over his arm and airily strode away.</p>

<small>FOLLOW YOUR LEADER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Carlota, where is your brother?”</p>

<p>“I do not know where he is now, Mrs. Burnham.
He went—went away by himself for a
little distance,” answered the girl, flushing
painfully.</p>

<p>“Went away? By himself? Why?” exclaimed
Mr. Burnham, in surprise.</p>

<p>They had stopped to eat their luncheon of
bread and milk, intending or, at least, hoping
to reach in time for supper some spot where
there would be water when Mrs. Burnham
would prepare something hot and palatable.</p>

<p>“I—I cannot tell you.”</p>

<p>“Do you know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Burnham.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you tell, then?”</p>

<p>“Because I promised not.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear. This is serious. Has anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
gone wrong?” persisted her host, yet
with great kindness of manner.</p>

<p>“No, I think not. But, if you please, I
would rather not talk.”</p>

<p>In her own mind she was sure that something
might have gone very wrong, indeed. The suggested
“hour or two” had stretched to twice
that time, and still he had not come in sight.
Nothing that moved was visible across the
mighty plain and its silence seemed intolerable.
The railroad gleamed in the sunshine till it
dwindled in the distance to a mere point and
vanished. Beside it ran a bordering road of
earth whereon the slower wheels of wagons
could crawl east or west; and along this, at intervals
pitifully short, were skeletons of cattle,
so ghastly and suggestive that, looking upon
them, Carlota’s heart filled with dread of her
brother’s fate.</p>

<p>She couldn’t eat. Even when, moved by her
evident distress though annoyed by her silence,
Mrs. Burnham made an especial dainty and
offered it.</p>

<p>“Thank you. You are very, very kind. If
you’re willing, I’ll take it for Carlos.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. But I must say it is the height<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
of imprudence for him to wander alone in this
wild region.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t timid,” answered Carlota, as
bravely as she could.</p>

<p>But Teddy, sitting upon her lap, saw a tear
escape and trickle down her cheek.</p>

<p>“Carlota! Bad Carlota! My muvver says
nobody must cwy this day. I did tumble me
down and stubbed me my toe an’ I cwied. Then
she told me that, about little boys going to find
gold mines an’ havin’ Christmas candy—forever
an’ ever an’ ever! So I stopped right off.
Isn’t it as naughty for girls to cwy as for
boys?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. Worse, if girls are older.”</p>

<p>It was a comfort to caress him and she reassured
herself by the thought that both she and
Carlos were used to wandering by themselves
and in safety, also reflected that the herd of
wild horses he had seen might have moved on
and so led him out of his way. Then she said
aloud, as much to herself as to Teddy:</p>

<p>“Brother knew that we were to go to that
Pass yonder, where the pointed rocks are and,
likely, he’ll meet us there.”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Burnham’s purpose to push his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
way through this Pass to the heart of the
mountainous land beyond, where lay the rich
tracts of which he had heard but which, because
of attending difficulties, had never been
properly “prospected.”</p>

<p>So Carlota slipped the treat of jam-spread
cake into the botany-box slung across her
shoulders, adding to it the slices of bread and
cheese she could not then enjoy, and explaining:</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll be hungrier, by and by, Mrs.
Burnham, so I’ll put this aside in my ‘box-of-all-work,’
as my father calls it.”</p>

<p>By this time all the self-glory of Dennis Fogarty
had been dried up by the tear upon the
cheek of his beloved “little lady.” He, as well
as Teddy, had seen that, and at the sight he forgot
everything save her unhappiness.</p>

<p>“Sure, ’tis past time for that brother o’ hers
to be showin’ himself. I thought, says I,
maybe they’d had a little scrap an’ he’d soon
come along to patch up the breach. But no,
says he. When he’s mad he stays mad, says
he—if mad it is! I’ll have a word with her the
now an’ see if aught is I can do to cheer her
belike.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>With that he pulled from his pocket a brilliant
cotton handkerchief, fresh from the pack
of a peddler upon a passing train. He had
purchased it on a day soon after this pilgrimage
was decided and when his ambition to become
a Mexican horseman was yet young. The
handkerchief represented a Spanish bull fight
and, in its general effect, was red enough to
have served as “flag” in its own combat. At
some opportune moment, Dennis had intended
to produce it with dazzling flourish, for the
amazement of his companions. He now resolved
upon a kindlier use. Unobserved by
Carlota, he begged of Mrs. Burnham a half-loaf
of bread and the greater luxury of a tiny
pat of butter. Scooping a hole in the crust of
the loaf he bestowed within it the butter, replaced
the crust he had removed, and carefully
wrapped the whole in the gaudy napkin. Then
he thrust the parcel into the breast of his
jacket and rejoined Carlota. The absent lad
might now appear at any moment and his inevitable
hunger was thus provided against.</p>

<p>“I s’pose there’s never a know ye know
where he’ll pop out of, since there’s no spot
in sight would hide Hop-o’-my-thumb, barrin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
a well grown lad like your own. But sure,
Miss Carlota, ’tis time he was shimmerin’
back. He’s that light o’ foot as I never saw
an’ ’tis pinin’ I be for a sight of his own merry
face.”</p>

<p>Now wily Dennis knew that the way to force
her confidence was to give her a bit of a heartache;
and he, like the Burnhams, felt that the
time for secrecy was past. She looked up into
his face and at sight of its sympathy her courage
gave way.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dennis! What do you suppose has happened
to him?”</p>

<p>“I could tell that better if I knew what he
went for to do.”</p>

<p>With a last rally of her bravery, she replied:</p>

<p>“Prob’ly, he knows best and will come when
he chooses. I hear the rumble of another
train. I like, now, to feel the jar along the
earth so long before they get in sight. I expect
that’s a heavy freight.”</p>

<p>“Hear to her! Do ye mind, Miss Carlota,
how scared ye was at a bit of a hand-car, that
first night ye come? Blessed be the day! An’
as wise now about freights an’ sleepers an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
‘overlands’ as the best. But look your fill at
this one’s on the road now. Soon we’ll be
beyant all such matters, if things go as they
should.”</p>

<p>The girl had not listened to all the wordy
fellow’s talk, but she had caught that statement
about leaving the line of railway, and
asked:</p>

<p>“Are they going to do that right away,
Dennis?”</p>

<p>“So the misthress was sayin’, forby.”</p>

<p>“Then—I cannot go with them. I must
either wait here for Carlos or try to find him.
Dennis, Dennis! Some harm has happened
my brother. I feel it, I know it!”</p>

<p>“Arra musha! What nonsense is this?
Unless, belike, he was after some mischief or
other,” returned the trackman, with an outward
show of scorn and an inward conviction
that her judgment was right.</p>

<p>“No. Oh! no, no, no. He was in no mischief.
He? My brother couldn’t do anything—anything—wrong.
No, Dennis Fogarty.
Maybe he was silly to go but he’ll come back.
The dear Lord won’t let any harm happen him,
I know. And yet, I cannot go away to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
Pass in the mountains without him. I—did
you say this burro was mine? Really and
truly my own?”</p>

<p>“Truth, did I. To have an’ to hold—if ye
can—forever. But why’s that, me small
Sainyereety?” quoth the Irishman, priding
himself upon his fine Spanish accent.</p>

<p>“If I go a little way toward the north to
look for my brother will you go with me, Dennis
dear?” she coaxed.</p>

<p>Happy Dennis! He struck his breast with
an air and—hit the bundle he had hidden
there, and the trivial incident altered his gravity
to mirth. A second before, infected by
her fear he had been certain that Carlos had
been killed in some accident; now his opinion
was wholly changed.</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s go with ye I will. An’ ’tis aye
safe an’ sound we’ll find him the now. But
hungry? Of course. Else why? See?” He
showed her the parcel of bread and they both
laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“Good Dennis! Kind Dennis! My father
will thank you, oh! so much! when he comes
home for—for all your niceness to his children.
So, let’s tell the others that we are going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
and go right away. Come, let’s. Quick.”</p>

<p>Since she would not, therefore, go unattended
and because he did not see how it was
possible for her, also, to get lost if she kept
her attention fixed upon that meeting point at
the Pass, Mr. Burnham consented to a temporary
division of their little party, warning:</p>

<p>“But be certain to ride back to us before
the night comes on, Carlota.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham added:</p>

<p>“And, Dennis, if you let harm happen so
much as a hair of her sunny head I shall know
you are something less than a man.”</p>

<p>So, delighted to have done with suspense
and to be upon the road toward her absent one,
the child gayly waved her hand and rode away.
Dennis, too, again placed his hand upon
his breast—and the loaf—in a supposed
“Greaser” style, and goaded the noble Cork
to follow whither the humble Connemara led.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>THE SNARES SNARED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Although, as far as the eye could reach, the
plateau appeared one unbroken level it was
crossed, midway, by an unwooded valley; and,
as he gained upon it, the herd of mustangs
which Carlos had seen feeding upon the hither
side of this hidden valley suddenly disappeared
from his view.</p>

<p>He ran lightly forward toward this vanishing
point of his coveted possession, thinking:</p>

<p>“That’s queer! They, certainly, were
horses and no mirage—such as we saw on that
other plain. That was strange, too; the
things we saw in the sky-picture were just
what we have since come to know so well; railroad,
cars, station, water-tank and all! In the
mirage everything was upside down, but the
horses I saw just now were walking on four
feet, their backs right side up, and quietly
feeding. Well, if I keep on I’ll surely find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
them. And how I’ll astonish Jack when I ride
back on a creature so much finer than his old
worn-outs! I’ll choose the very handsomest
of the band and, if I have half-luck, I’ll catch it—thus!”</p>

<p>He whirled his lasso around his head, flung
it, and deftly cleft the cactus spike toward
which he had aimed.</p>

<p>“Well done, Carlos! Excellent! Ha! I’m
proud of my father’s son this day. I didn’t
know I had learned so well. If Miguel were
here he’d push out his lips and say: ‘Ah! it
might be worse!’ Poor old Miguel! and Dennis
so jealous of him.”</p>

<p>Tossing the cactus aside he rewound his lariat
for fresh efforts. At that moment, a wild
turkey flew over his head; so low that it was
almost within reach and so slowly that he knew
it had been wounded in some manner.</p>

<p>“It’s not manly sport to catch a hurt creature
yet—a bird on the wing, even a broken one—I’ll
try. I’m glad Carlota isn’t here for
she’d call me cruel. She’s a darling little sister
but, sometimes, she does make a big fuss
about—nothing at all.”</p>

<p>Watching his chance, he flung the riata upward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
and caught the wounded thing. It fell
at his feet, dying, and a curious chill crept
through the lad’s veins.</p>

<p>“That’s because of silly old Marta. I’ve
listened to her omens till I always remember
them, and <i>that’s</i> ignorance, my father says.
Yet, ‘Who snares the wounded shall himself
be snared.’ Pooh! I’ve put it out of misery,
anyway. Ha! There’s a road-runner! It’s
not hurt and how, if besides my horse, I take
back fresh game for our suppers? Then, indeed,
will that boy think that ‘poor Carlos,’
who must trudge afoot while his neighbor
rides, is of some account in camp.”</p>

<p>Again he flung his slender cord and this
time he failed. But nothing discouraged, he
wound it afresh, to be ready for more serious
business and believing that the horses must
be very near.</p>

<p>They were; much nearer than he thought;
for as he turned toward the west, he saw close
before him the beginning of that hidden, treeless,
valley into which they had retreated.</p>

<p>His approach had been unnoticed. The herd
had found a “tank,” or one of the large, hollow
rocks filled with water, with which nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
supplies her children’s need in that land of few
streams. The animals were drinking deeply,
eagerly, and his selection could be carefully
made. After it had been, Carlos thought, that
he, also, would quench his thirst at the “tank”
but—business first!</p>

<p>Deciding which was the very finest one of
all the band, he took careful, deliberate aim,
shot the <i>riata</i>, and caught the unsuspecting
beast by one of its forelegs.</p>

<p>Then there was consternation in the herd
but, careless of other endangering hoofs or
aught but his capture, the well-trained lad
rushed forward headlong and closed with his
captive. This was no new task for him. He
had been taught the trick of “catching and
throwing” by more than one employee, or passing
sojourner, at Refugio, while his steel-like
young muscles well endured the strain now put
upon them. He had been an apt pupil and it
was Miguel’s boast that the lad could beat his
instructors at their own business. Yet the contest
which ensued between the wild mustang
and the excited boy was long and severe.
There was will on each side but the human
will was aided by watchful intelligence; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
when the young horse-breaker had gained a
seat upon his captive’s back he was satisfied,
though some would have fancied the battle but
just begun.</p>

<p>“Fight—caper—rear—buck—kick—do your
worst! Have a care! Now, quiet—quiet,
there, and—steady!”</p>

<p>He got his fingers to the animal’s nostrils
and his lips to its ear, and what magic influence
there was thus exerted only those wise in
horse-lore can explain. The result was amazing.
The mustang quivered in fear, tried once
more, and futilely, to throw the boy from its
back, then stood stock-still. Then Carlos relaxed
his own muscles and suddenly was impelled
to look up.</p>

<p>As silently as he had stolen upon the unconscious
herd in the valley so silently he had himself
been surrounded. Indians to right of him—Indians
to the left of him—Indians everywhere!</p>

<p>Odd! But his first thought was that silly
adage of old Marta:</p>

<p>“Who snares the wounded shall himself be
snared.”</p>

<p>Then he rallied. He was as brave as most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
lads, braver than many. He had done some
wonderful deeds of skill, that day, and his veins
still thrilled with pride in his own achievements.
Of Indians in general he was not
afraid; and he saw, at once, that these did not
wear the dress of the hostile Apaches. Yet
their faces were stern and uncompromising as,
in silence, the eldest of the company advanced
and laid his hand on the youngster’s shoulder.</p>

<p>This old man nodded toward another brave,
who seemed to give assent, and in that same
terrifying silence the others grouped themselves
about their chief. He signaled a youth,
who promptly passed to Carlos’s side, where
he still sat upon the subdued mustang and,
with the pretty lariat which had done such
clever work that day, bound its owner’s arms
behind his back.</p>

<p>Poor Carlos! This indignity, to be tied like
a criminal and with his own rope, was so bitter
that anger rose and banished fear. He
tossed his head defiantly, squared his shoulders,
and gazed unflinchingly down the shallow valley
along which he must ride to his fate.</p>

<p>Those who followed glanced admiringly at
his superb little figure, riding proud and unsupported,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
and many nods of satisfaction were
exchanged among them. Such a small brave
would be a worthy addition to their tribe.</p>

<p>After a time, the valley turned sharply toward
the northwestern mountains, and the
prisoner fixed his gaze upon them, sadly thinking:</p>

<p>“How little did I dream of entering them
like this! Poor, poor Carlota! Her heart
will break.”</p>

<p>Stop! He must not think of Carlota. He
must think of nothing that would unman him.
If he must die there, in the wilderness, it
should be as became his father’s son!</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>IN THE DARKNESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>But Carlos was not to die.</p>

<p>The Indians, into whose hands he had fallen,
were of the most peaceable tribe left in the
wide west—Zunis, of the Pueblos; and it was
toward one of their villages, or pueblos—from
which they take their race name—that they
now conducted him. They had recently been
greatly harassed by some of their lawless neighbors
and intended to make an example of their
captive, though without personal injury.</p>

<p>As they advanced on their journey Carlos
noticed in surprise that there were fine fields
of corn and well cultivated vineyards along the
banks of a stream and felt that they must be
nearing some great rancho. He had heard his
father describe the curious villages of the Pueblos
and hoped that it was to such a place that
he was being taken; for, even in this strait, his
curiosity was great and he was eager to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
new things. Moreover, the ride continued so
long that his spirits rose as he reflected:</p>

<p>“Evidently, they aren’t going to kill me yet
awhile.”</p>

<p>Then he stole a glance into the face of the
brave walking nearest him and observed that
while it was as stern as ever it was not at all
“blood thirsty.” This increased both his courage
and his interest.</p>

<p>“What a tale I shall have to tell—if I live to
tell it! I believe I shall. I’m sure these must
be some of the ‘good Indians’ which the Captain
said were all dead. They look almost less
Indian than Mexican, though they are very tall
and straight. That old fellow in front is splendid.
I wish, oh! how I do wish, I had learned to
talk Pueblo when Carlota did and my father
warned me, indeed, coaxed me. He said that,
living as we did, among so many different people,
we should study the language of each.
That I would find then the ‘knowledge’ that’s
‘power.’ It would be ‘power,’ indeed, if I were
able to ask these people if they know what they
are doing and to whom they are doing it!”</p>

<p>At this point he cast a haughty look about him
and gave his comely head a higher toss.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
What? What was that? Did he detect something
like a grim smile on the lips of that young
fellow at the left?</p>

<p>If so, the smile was too fleeting to have been
real. The man was merely adjusting the folds
of his blanket, and it might have been a shadow
of these which nettled Carlos.</p>

<p>Nettled he was; and, although he knew he
would not be understood, he angrily demanded:</p>

<p>“Who are you? What are you going to do
with me?”</p>

<p>At sound of his voice the leader of the party
turned half about, as if to answer, but checked
the seeming impulse; and, in the same stolid
silence, the party pressed forward among the
scattered shrubs and trees which now marked
their path.</p>

<p>Gradually, the trees increased in size and
number. There were other and wider streams,
at one of which a man stooped and filled a
gourd that hung at his waist. He offered this
to Carlos, holding it to the lad’s parched lips
with a kindliness of gesture that, surely, betokened
no malice.</p>

<p>Carlos would have pushed the gourd away,
but nature was too strong for this; so, setting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
his lips to the rim, he drained the cup to the
bottom.</p>

<p>“Oh! how delicious that was! Thank you!”
said he gratefully.</p>

<p>The gourd was refilled and emptied a second
time; then the Indian himself drank. So did
several others of the party which numbered,
as the prisoner judged without seeing those
behind him, a dozen or more men.</p>

<p>Onward again; the long unbroken strides of
the redskins equalling the restless pace of the
led mustang upon which the captive rode. He
was about to ask if he, also, might get down
and walk; hoping to make them understand
his gestures if not his words, when a sudden
turn of the mountain spur disclosed the picture
he had longed to see. Before him, on a terrace-like
hill, lay a cluster of adobe huts, or, as
it rather seemed, one wide-spreading habitation
which might shelter many people.</p>

<p>If his captors did not understand his speech,
at least, they did his smile of satisfaction, as
he cried:</p>

<p>“A Pueblo village! Then I am safe!”</p>

<p>He eagerly studied it as it lay, gradually
rising upon the slope, its succession of roofs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
appearing like some gigantic stairway. Upon
the roofs some women were sitting, weaving.
He noticed the ladder-like arrangement, leading
from the ground to the top, by which the
buildings could be entered; though there were,
also, openings here and there upon the level of
the foundation. His observation was terminated
by somebody’s lifting him from his
horse and tieing his own sash over his eyes.</p>

<p>“You shall not! You—shall—not! If I
am to die—I’ll die with my eyes wide open!”
he screamed, excitedly. For now his fear had
returned and he as confidently expected death
as he had life, but a moment before.</p>

<p>There followed some talk among those who
had been most active in his capture, and then
he was again lifted and borne onward, upward,
as it seemed, though he could neither see nor
help himself save by his shrieks which, however,
availed him nothing. Thus, struggling
and protesting, he was carried whither his captors
chose; and, after what seemed an hour but
was only a few minutes, he was unceremoniously
dumped upon an earthen floor.</p>

<p>Leaping to his feet he peered around him.
He seemed to be alone and he was in darkness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>THE EVENING AND THE MORNING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>When they left Tuttle for the mountains, the
young Manuels had obtained permission to
resume their own costumes. They had found
the skirts and fitted bodice for Carlota, and the
bagging overalls for Carlos, most annoying,
and once more arrayed in their familiar garments
they “felt like themselves.” Dennis,
almost enviously, admired the simplicity of
Carlota’s clothing and was proud to attend a
maiden so picturesquely attired.</p>

<p>“Faith, me little lady, ye might be one o’
them Injun chiefseses’ daughters herself, so
ye might! An’, if we meet up with any, they’ll
go easy like, forby they’d be botherin’ their
own kin.”</p>

<p>“I guess they’d soon find out the difference.
My hair is yellow and an Indian’s is always
dark. Dennis, did you know I could talk a little
of their language?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“Sure, an’ I didn’t but I believe it entire.
Me purty dear, you’re that clever—”</p>

<p>“That’s not ‘clever.’ Clever means to be
very wise, like my father. But learning to talk
different ways, why, that’s just fun. I used
to show our visiting Indians something and
they would tell me the name of it; then they
would ask me for it, in real earnest, maybe, and
I would soon know what they meant. Dennis,
if I live to be a woman I mean to know about
every language there is in the whole world, and
about every single flower, too. Or if—not
every—then as many as I can. I do, really.”</p>

<p>He regarded her with all-believing eyes, yet
there crept a touch of commiseration into his
honest face.</p>

<p>“Hear to the purty girleen! But ’tis a fine
headache you’ll be havin’ all your life, Miss
Carlota. Och! You will that.”</p>

<p>“Knowing things doesn’t make your head
ache, Dennis Fogarty. How can you think
so?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I know, I know. Once, Miss Carlota,
away back in Connemara, I was sent to the
priest to be taught. Arrah musha, the day!”
He bitterly groaned, remembering it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“Well, what of it? Come on, please. Don’t
let your Cork drag along so or we shall never
be there. That’s better. I don’t mean to
hurry you, but I’m so glad to be moving, and I
do think the broncho travels more and more
slowly all the time. I’m afraid that when you
conquered him you took all the heart out of
him. But, what about you and the priest?”</p>

<p>“Sure, it was mighty little. ’Twas only one
day betwixt us. I goes in the morning, goes I,
along with more little gossoons; an’ there sits
his riverence, all easy like, in his chair. So we
pays him our duty as we should, ye understand,
an’ he stands us all up in a row. Then he
whips out a card with them things they call
letters printed out on’t, big an’ bold. I was
the top o’ the row; an’: ‘Dennis Fogarty,’ says
he, ‘what’s that thing?’ says he.</p>

<p>“‘Faith, Father,’ says I, ‘’tis nought but a
couple o’ black streaks with another streak
crossin’ them same.’ ‘’Tis <i>A</i>!’ says the
father, says he. But—”</p>

<p>The narrator paused, groaned, and moved
uneasily, as if the memory were painful. Or—was
it the saddle?</p>

<p>“Well, and what then? What next? Dennis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
when my Miguel is telling a story he never
stops right in the most interesting part.
Never.”</p>

<p>“Yes, me dear. I know, I know. But, little
lady, that there ‘Greaser’ never went to school
in Connemara!”</p>

<p>“You did! But you’ll never get away from
that school nor tell me what you learned at it,
if you don’t hurry. Now—what next?”</p>

<p>The ex-trackman scratched his head.</p>

<p>“Hmm. The next thing was a crack on me
pate! an’ that is the sum an’ the substance of
all me book learnin’, avick!”</p>

<p>“Why, Dennis! Did you give up your education
for such a trifle as that?”</p>

<p>“‘Trifle,’ says the little colleen! ’Twas no
trifle, at all, at all, to get hit with the father’s
shillalah; an’ the smart o’ the blow—belike,
I’m feelin’ it yet!”</p>

<p>He rubbed his hard head with such a comical
grimace that Carlota laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“Was that, really, all you ever studied?”</p>

<p>“All, says you? Sure, ’twas more nor
enough. Home I went to me dad an’ he topped
off the crack of the priest’s stick with a crack
of his own, and set me to hoein’ the praties.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
Yes, I know, I know. Learnin’ is nice for them
that can’t get on without it, but Dennis Fogarty’s
the boy as can. Och! This ridin’
like a gentleman is a’ most harder nor walkin’
the track, so it be.”</p>

<p>“How soon do you s’pose we’ll find my
brother?”</p>

<p>“Bother! But yourself is the one for questions!”</p>

<p>“It is you who are bothering, Dennis; for
though I ask them I notice that you never answer.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ll answer that one. We’ll
meet up with him by sundown!”</p>

<p>“That’s a dear Dennis. That’s quite as
kind as Miguel and very like him. He always
promises whatever I wish, whether he can keep
his promise or not. I think I like that, anyway,
it makes you feel so good inside. But,
come on! I’ll race Connemara against master
Cork! Straight to the ‘north!’ The way
our father went, the way my Carlos followed,
and now—we. Go!”</p>

<p>The burro set off on a short-paced but steady
trot and Dennis valiantly tried to keep up; but
Cork would not be urged, cajoled, nor punished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
into faster than a walking gait, which irritated
Carlota and secretly gratified the ex-trackman.</p>

<p>Only those who, at their first trial, have continued
horseback exercise for hours can understand
his sufferings. But finally, the girl suspected
the truth and modified the burro’s pace.
She even suggested that Dennis should walk.</p>

<p>“Would—Meegell?”</p>

<p>“Yes. If I told him to,” she replied, convincingly.</p>

<p>The alacrity with which the Irishman dismounted
was proof of his relief; also, that he
would not be outdone in anything by the unknown
Mexican.</p>

<p>Yet, walking seemed very slow, and though
they tried to make the way merry by stories,
and plans for the future when they should all—including
Dennis Fogarty, Miner—be back
at Refugio, they had not accomplished any
great distance before the sudden twilight of the
west came down upon them. Nor, apparently,
were they any nearer meeting the lost lad than
when they left the Burnham’s wagon.</p>

<p>Both were wise concerning the perils of
lonely night-travel in that region, so decided to
turn aside into a little ravine which suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
water and a camping place. It was even, by
some miles, nearer the mountains they had
hoped to reach, but they did not realize this
then.</p>

<p>Making what haste they could to the spot
they had chosen they found, as they had hoped,
a spring of refreshing water, and dropping
down beside it drew long breaths of delight.
Then they plunged their hot faces into the little
stream and drank deeply.</p>

<p>“Sure, that was better than bein’ made President
o’ this fine counthry, it was!” exclaimed
Dennis, but Carlota only sighed in content.
Physical comfort influenced her mind, also, so
that she said, after another moment of rest:</p>

<p>“Somehow, I don’t feel so worried about
Carlos, now. Do you?”</p>

<p>“’Tis meself that never was.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were.”</p>

<p>“Acushla! Thinkin’ an’ bein’ is two different
matters, Miss Carlota. That fine brother
o’ yours is a nimble gossoon, so he be. If he
slips into a scrape he’ll easy slip out again.
So, bein’s we’re here, we’d best take another
sup o’ that blessed water an’ a bite to eat, and
be off to the land o’ dreams.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“I’ll help you. I know how to saddle and
unsaddle a horse as well as any <i>caballero</i> on
the rancho. See—this quick way! Now, take
a handful of grass and rub down your Cork,
while I do the same for Connemara. Then
we’ll tether them where they can get a good
supper and lie down to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Not before you’d eat a bit, little lady!” protested
the hungry man.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m too tired to eat.”</p>

<p>“Then so be I!” he asserted with a lengthening
face.</p>

<p>“But you must. You need food.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, I know. Howsumever, ’tis not
the Fogarty’ll do that when his Miss Carlota
goes supperless to bed,” he plaintively answered.</p>

<p>“I—I was saving mine.”</p>

<p>“And I.”</p>

<p>“Dennis, for whom?”</p>

<p>“For that same as yourself. Sure.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you’re a dear, kind fellow!”</p>

<p>To the ex-trackman this seemed almost as
much sustenance as would that loaf which he
was so conscious of having inside his jacket—“So
handy like to tempt a poor lad.” Indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
they were both very hungry. Also, they were
both perfectly healthy; therefore, their self-denial
was short-lived.</p>

<p>“Dennis?” she called to him, in the dim
light.</p>

<p>“Yes, me little lady.”</p>

<p>“I think—we might take—just a little of—of
the crust.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinkin’ that same.”</p>

<p>“Besides, I have the jam-cake.”</p>

<p>“Faith, an’ what more could a runaway ask?
More, by token, to-morrow’s not come an’ to
each day falls its lot, says I.”</p>

<p>With that he pulled forth his loaf and spread
the gay kerchief on Carlota’s lap.</p>

<p>“Do ye mind that, me dear? Sure, there’s
more nor a plenty for us an’ him, too—when
he comes.”</p>

<p>Alas! it is the first step that counts. In this
case, the first slice; Dennis cut that very thick
and bountifully spread it with butter from the
hidden store. This he gave to the girl, who ate
it more rapidly and unthinkingly than she had
ever eaten anything before. As she did so, all
fatigue passed away and, perching herself
upon a rock, she swung her feet in a satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
fashion that did the heart of Dennis Fogarty
great good.</p>

<p>For once he did not wait till she had finished,
and soon he, also, felt the comfort of food.
That he did not swing his feet, as she did, was
simply because he was sitting upon the ground
and could not; but he began to sing in that
funny monotone which he considered music and
that was, at least, an outward expression of his
inward content.</p>

<p>“Dennis, that was so good! If there’ll be
enough, I’d like just another little tiny bit.”</p>

<p>The tender hearted fellow craftily hid the
loaf behind him as he pretended to examine it,
then cheerfully replied:</p>

<p>“Enough, says she? Faith, there’s enough
an’ more nor plenty for a dozen like ye. An’
butter—galore.”</p>

<p>With that ferocious dirk of his, he slashed
off another thick portion and gave it to her;
but he did not take a second piece for himself,
though his stomach lustily demanded the indulgence,
and with heroic sacrifice he put the
remnant of the bread as far behind him as he
could reach.</p>

<p>Afterward, he pulled branches from the small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
pines about the spring and piled them for Carlota’s
bed; over these he spread his own fine
<i>serape</i> and, with a magnificent wave of his
hand, motioned his “little lady” to take her
needed rest.</p>

<p>“Thank you, good Dennis. I believe I was
almost asleep, right here on the rock. It’s a
lovely bed, but first, I must say my prayers.”</p>

<p>So the grizzled, labor-worn man and the innocent
child knelt together and put themselves
and their desires into the safe keeping of the
loving Father who cared for them alike.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, they were both asleep,
unconscious of danger or treachery; Dennis
happily snoring and Carlota dreaming of Refugio
and its beloved garden. Nor to either
did it seem more than a moment before they
were suddenly awakened, to find the sun already
rising and a tall figure looming above
them.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>AN IRISH-INDIAN ONSLAUGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Carlota leaped to her feet and Dennis tried
to rise, but a heavy foot was on his breast and
a stern face bent over him, while an uplifted
forefinger pointed dismay into his inmost soul.</p>

<p>“Me hour has come!” thought the unhappy
fellow, but he made no further effort to move.
The command of those unflinching eyes was not
to be disobeyed. He wondered if the intruder’s
hand held the weapon with which he
would be killed, but was almost too terrified to
care. In his horror he felt himself already
dying and his eyelids fluttered back into place
as if for the last time.</p>

<p>“Oh! that is his salvation! If he will only
keep them shut till it is over!” thought Carlota,
watching.</p>

<p>After her sudden uprising she had not
moved, and this fact was a relief to the stranger,
so steadily regarding the prostrate Irishman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
If she had screamed it would, probably,
have brought the affair to a fatal and immediate
climax. Thus a moment passed; another—more—an
interminable time! The trio of
human beings remained rigid, spellbound by as
many varying emotions, while those terrible
ten minutes which seemed an eternity dragged
by. Then the foot was lifted from Dennis’s
chest and he was gruffly ordered to: “Get up.”</p>

<p>At first, he was powerless to obey. Not
until the sound of a sharp blow, followed by a
grunt of satisfaction sent a thrill of new life
through his palsied veins. Then he rose and
saw the man who had menaced him standing a
few feet away and pointing to the ground
where he lay, crushed to lifelessness, a monstrous
and most poisonous centipede.</p>

<p>“He died, not you,” said the stranger, in
broken English.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dennis! That dreadful thing was almost
upon your throat. Oh! horrible,” cried
Carlota.</p>

<p>Dennis threw back his knotted hand to his
neck and plucked away an imaginary reptile.
He began to feel them crawling over him, everywhere.
He had not sufficient composure left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
in which to thank the stranger, who, however,
expected nothing of the sort. He comforted
the Irishman by saying:</p>

<p>“No more. Mate killed. Not plenty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear Dennis, you’re safe now, I’m
sure. It seemed as if the dreadful creature
would never, never finish his crawling over
you. The whole width of your body and so
slow! If you’d moved or disturbed him he
would have thrust his deadly fangs into your
flesh and you’d have died. I’ve heard about
those things. It was the kind God kept you,
dear old Dennis, and sent this good man just in
time to save you.”</p>

<p>Dennis was truly thankful and humble; yet
he rubbed his confused head and wondered
what need there had been of the peril if rescue
were foreordained. However, such problems
were too deep for his simple mind and he
looked up in a manner to reveal the amusing
perplexity he felt.</p>

<p>“Escapin’ the serpent to fall into the Injun’s
hands! The fire an’ the fryin’-pan, belike.”</p>

<p>The rescuer was, indeed, an Indian, though
he spoke fairly good English. But Carlota
paid less heed to him than to the possibility of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
her wandering brother having suffered the
same fate which had just menaced Dennis and,
it might be, herself also. Laying her hand
upon the stranger’s arm, she begged:</p>

<p>“Oh! tell me, please, have you seen a boy
anywhere?”</p>

<p>The Irishman shivered in alarm at the girl’s
audacity, yet no harm ensued. The Indian
merely looked at her and answered by one
word: “Plenty.”</p>

<p>“Where? Oh! please, please say where!
Was it hereabouts? My brother, my twin—”</p>

<p>Then, indeed, did a curious smile show upon
the redskin’s face. He wheeled around and
pointed up the mountain through a canyon that
seemed a continuation of the ravine where they
then stood. Whatever his ability, he made
scant use of his English, for all he answered
was: “Come.”</p>

<p>Just then uprose a direful cry from the Fogarty:</p>

<p>“Ochone! Me bread! Me horse! The
thievin’ creatur’! I’ll break every bone in his
carcass, I will that!”</p>

<p>Even the dignified Indian was interested.
There was Dennis again at war with his tethered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
broncho, who was nonchalantly nibbling
the last of the priceless loaf—their own breakfast.</p>

<p>“Dennis! Dennis! Are you going to fight
him every day, as you did Mr. Grady? Stop—I’m
ashamed of you.”</p>

<p>“Stop, is it? An’ the breakfast clean
gone?”</p>

<p>“But that is your fault, not his. You
shouldn’t have left it where he could get it.
Besides, who knows but it is all dirty and—and
centipede-y?”</p>

<p>The Indian waited until there was a lull in
affairs, then quietly untied the broncho,
motioned that Carlota should mount her burro—still
unsaddled, and taking the leading straps
of both animals, strode up the canyon at a
rapid pace. By a gesture he indicated that
Dennis was to bring the saddles, blankets, and
other belongings of the pair; and so intimidated
was Mr. Fogarty that he dared not disobey.</p>

<p>Carlota rode as silent as her guide. She
guessed that he was taking her to some settlement
and she saw that he was such as had frequented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
Refugio, and from whom she had
never received other than kind treatment. She
was consumed by anxiety concerning Carlos
but, from her father’s talks and her own slight
experience, she knew sufficient of Indian character
to understand that this silence would best
serve her purpose. She had asked for information
and the stranger had answered,
“Come.”</p>

<p>So because of her faith that she was being
swiftly led to her brother, her heart grew light
and she began to sing; and hearing the song
floating down to him through the gulch, poor
Dennis made a virtue of necessity and loaded
himself worse than any pack mule. Then he
started forward whither the others had now
disappeared.</p>

<p>It was a brief but anxious pilgrimage. At
every step he fancied a creeping, stinging reptile
beneath his feet, though he reckoned upon
the protection which his mighty boots were to
him. On either shoulder he bore a saddle
which continually grew heavier, as is the habit
of burdens carried. The blanket and <i>serape</i>
airily floated anywhere it happened, underfoot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
or overhead, at the caprice of the wind; and the
tin box of his “little lady” played a jingling
accompaniment to the whole.</p>

<p>“Faith! ’tis well I’d all that fine practice,
hod-carryin’ to them tall buildin’s in Chicago,
before I took up with railroadin’, now isn’t it,
Mr. Fogarty?” he ejaculated, as he neared his
journey’s end.</p>

<p>A moment later, as he came in sight of the
pueblo and a group of its inhabitants assembled
before it, he complacently added:</p>

<p>“An’ sure’s me name’s Dennis, they’re all
waitin’ to receive me!”</p>

<p>As he approached the spot a shout was
raised, and his elation vanished. Believing it
to be a “war cry,” the vicissitudes of the
morning ended in collapse. He caught a
glimpse of Carlota being lifted from her burro
and led away between two squaws. It seemed
to him that these forced her up a steep ladder,
then threw her downward into some invisible
depth. Heaped with his own burdens, the
Irishman sank to the ground. An ague of fear
shook him, his face paled, and a cold sweat
came out upon his temples. Cowering thus in
terror, he saw the assembled Indians swoop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
down upon him from the terrace. Then, as do
those in mortal extremity, he began to see
visions and dream dreams, and fancy suddenly
brought before him the face, as he had imagined
it, of Miguel, the Hated! In similar circumstance,
what would this much-envied
“Greaser” have done?</p>

<p>The thought of the Spaniard acted like a
tonic. With a yell as wild as an Indian’s own,
Dennis now arose, while the encumbering blankets
and saddles fell unheeded about him.
Thrusting his hand into his belt he unsheathed
his dangerous dirk, crying:</p>

<p>“Carlota! Me own little lady! Have no
fear! ’Tis comin’ I am—so ’ware to ye, ye
bloodthirsty, murderin’ Injuns! Leave her go—leave!”</p>

<p>Mad with his own prowess he blindly rushed
forward, his shining blade catching the rays of
the sun and fiercely heralding his advance.</p>

<p>But, hark! His enemies were upon him!
He made one tremendous lunge with his terrible
knife, and Mr. Fogarty knew no more.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>CONFLICTING EMOTIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Dennis! Dennis! Please open your eyes.
O, Dennis! How could you be so foolish?”</p>

<p>“Eh? What? Hey? An’ be I still—alive?”</p>

<p>“It’s not by your own merit that you are.
But, since you’ve only broken your arm and
cracked your head, I’m thankful to scold you,
Dennis. Silly, silly fellow!”</p>

<p>The ex-trackman and amateur desperado
raised his sound arm and carefully examined
his head. It ached badly, yet it seemed intact.</p>

<p>“Skull, is it? An’ where is the break in it?”</p>

<p>“Of course, I don’t mean that, exactly. You
bumped it pretty hard. What were you meaning
to do, Dennis?”</p>

<p>He tried to rise but failed. Then he looked
about him and realized that he was lying on a
straw pallet, upon one of those curious roofs
he had seen rising before him, when he engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
in the late combat. He reproachfully regarded
Carlota, who sat comfortably curled up, her
face bright, her hair freshly brushed, and her
whole attitude one of entire complacency.
Yet, as he made a second effort to rise and
turned giddy, her expression changed to one
of pity.</p>

<p>“There, poor dear, lie still. I’ll tell you all
about it. Oh! Dennis, we’ve found friends!
Wait. I forgot that the chief’s wife said you
were to drink this as soon as you awoke.”</p>

<p>She lifted his head upon her arm and held
an earthen bowl to his lips and he drank from
it, eagerly. He was both faint and thirsty
and the warm liquid was very grateful to him.
It was a broth of meat which he, at once,
termed “victuals an’ drink.”</p>

<p>“There, that is good. The others say that
she is a fine ‘medicine woman’ and it should
give you strength.”</p>

<p>All this was very astonishing to the injured
man whose chief interest, however, concerned
himself.</p>

<p>“What happened to me, Miss Carlota?”</p>

<p>“Why—I guess you tried to kill somebody—and
he objected. The young men who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
going to their daily tasks were gathered on the
terrace, singing—”</p>

<p>“‘Singin’,’ says she!”</p>

<p>“Surely. It’s the custom in this pueblo.
So the woman told me. It’s their ‘labor song,’
before they go down into the fields to work. A
hymn to the Great Spirit, praising him and
asking his blessing on the day. I think it’s a
lovely ceremony and when we get home to
Refugio, I shall ask my father to have our men
do just that way. Only, I’m afraid some of
them won’t wish it. They aren’t very revi—reverentiational.
That isn’t the right word,
Dennis, but it means doing honor to God.
But, oh, Dennis! I am so happy!”</p>

<p>This amazing statement aroused the
wounded man’s curiosity and so aided his
recovery.</p>

<p>“I—maybe I can sit up now. I’m dead,
entirely, but—I’ll try.”</p>

<p>“You’re better, Dennis Fogarty. And if
you’re alive how can you be dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, I know. But if Injuns can
sing hymns—Faith! It must be in some
better world nor any I’ve seen. So we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
all be together in another. Injuns! Arrah
musha! The beasts!”</p>

<p>“You are not in another world, you are still
in the same dear old one where you’ve always
been. You’re a darling fellow, but you’re
almost as silly as ‘The Dancer.’ Now you
must listen. First: this is a Pueblo village.
It belongs to a very peaceful tribe. My
brother is here; Carlos, my own brother, and
he is safe, too. Can you understand?”</p>

<p>“Sure, Miss Carlota, have I no wits
entirely? If he’s here, why isn’t he here?
Tell me that, if ye please.”</p>

<p>She laughed, then answered rather soberly:</p>

<p>“Why, it’s the oddest thing! They’ve
‘arrested’ him!”</p>

<p>“They’ve what? ’Deed, it’s muddled I
am.”</p>

<p>“It’s like what my father told about people
who did wrong in the big towns and cities.
Other people take the wrong-doing people and
put them in a prison. Well, they have put my
Carlos, my own sweetest, innocentest brother,
in a sort of prison here. The woman told me
and that I should see him very soon. They’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
going to have his ‘trial’ this morning and you
must get well right off. Think of it! Can’t
you hurry up? But, of course, soon as he tells
them it will be all right. He has done nothing
he should be punished for.”</p>

<p>Dennis drew himself up and bolstered his
back against an angle of the next roof. The
sun was getting high and the shadow he thus
obtained soothed his still aching head. But
Carlota was native to that land and unclouded
sunshine never disturbed her. It merely set
her golden hair a-glitter while she unblinkingly
studied the details of this mud-built pueblo.
In the adoring gaze of the Irishman she seemed
herself to radiate sunshine and he winked fast,
as if the vision blinded him; or to hide a tell-tale
tear, forced from him by weakness and
dismay. But she saw the betraying drop and
taxed him with it:</p>

<p>“Crying? You, Dennis? When you should
be so thankful? Or does your arm pain you?
Of course it must, yet wasn’t it a good way the
oldest ‘medicine man’ fixed it? Adobe mud, or
something, outside the sticks, which are not to
be touched, he says, for ‘a moon and a moon.’
That’s their queer kind of clock. By then it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
will be better than the other arm, which you
might break to match, if you like!”</p>

<p>She leaned back, laughing at her own conceit,
and, since he had the happy faculty of making
fun at his own expense, he joined in her mirth.
Yet he felt that their situation was graver than
she realized, and begged:</p>

<p>“Begin at the very start o’ the matter, if ye
please, Miss Carlota, an’ tell it me body an’
bones, from when ye rode off with the Injun an’
left me to carry the truck.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t my fault, poor Dennis. I’d
have stayed to help you if I could but even I
was a little afraid—then. I’m not now. I’m
so happy because Carlos is here. He is well.
No centipede stung him, and nothing hurt him.
We’ll see him soon and we’ll tell them that— But
I’m getting to be as great a talker as you,
Dennis, dear. Do you wish another drink?”</p>

<p>He nodded, and now was fully able to hold
the bowl for himself with his uninjured arm.</p>

<p>“We rode from you clear to the pueblo without
a word said, though I saw the man often
look at my clothes. Then up to my hair, and
down to the ground. All the time I was longing
to ask—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>“Sure, ’twas hard for ye not!”</p>

<p>“But as soon as we came here we saw
women, squaws, at work. They were getting
breakfast, broiling meat upon coals and baking
little cakes of meal. They, too, looked at me
as if I were—they didn’t know what! Their
clothes are more like Marta’s and Anita’s than
mine are. Much prettier things than the old
blue ones Mrs. Burnham gave me.”</p>

<p>“Did they give ye a bit o’ their breakfast,
Miss Carlota?”</p>

<p>“Afterward. Plenty of it and it was nice.
But, don’t interrupt, please, or I’ll never get
through. As soon as the man who brought us
had spoken to them in their own language—which
they didn’t know that I knew, too, a
little—they came and took my hands. They
smiled at me and yet I thought they looked
sorry. One of them touched my tunic and said
something which means ‘pretty.’ So, I told
her all about it. Then they led me up to one
of these queer roofs and down into the house.
It is very cosy and comfortable. There is a
sort of fireplace, though I think they do their
cooking out of doors when it’s as pleasant as
now. One of them washed my face, just as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
I’d been a baby, or Teddy; and they brushed
my hair with a curious comb that pulled it
dreadfully.”</p>

<p>“Bad cess to the meddlesome creatur’s!”</p>

<p>“Oh! no. It was all in kindness; and just as
I was hoping for my breakfast, there were you,
outside the walls, making such trouble for us
both! Dennis, why did you run at the men
with your knife?”</p>

<p>“Arrah musha! ’Twas themselves came
runnin’ to me, first hand; yellin’ like wildcats,
as they be!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. That was the song, the hymn,
as I told you. It wasn’t music I liked very
well, though it sounded a good deal like the
way you sing, Dennis, dear,” she commented,
frankly. “They saw you carrying the saddles
and things and, from the man who brought us,
they’d heard about the centipede. They
meant to bid you only a decent welcome, yet
you rushed at them as if you would murder
them. You would, too, if one of them hadn’t
caught your arm just in time. He hurried to
stop you and snatched away your dirk, but that
threw you to the ground and your head struck
a stone. The women said that your arm was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
doubled under you and they thought you were
killed.”</p>

<p>“Hmm. I know; I know. Bad cess to me
for an ill-thriven idjut!”</p>

<p>“No. I understand. You thought, as the
Captain did, that there could be but one kind of
Indian. Yet you should have known better,
after that good one saved your life from the
centipede. That’s all. Your arm has been
fixed and you’ve been fed; and as soon as they
have had that—that ‘trial’—of Carlos, we’ll
go on again and try to find the Burnhams. I
wish they’d hurry it up!”</p>

<p>“Wisha, for what are they ‘tryin’’ him?”</p>

<p>“For—taking a horse. Just a horse.”</p>

<p>“Wh-e-ew!” said Dennis and said no more.
He had lived in that region long enough to
know that horse stealing is the unforgivable
crime, against white man or red; and, indeed,
this made the affair a most serious one.</p>

<p>Carlota was frightened by his manner and
quickly demanded:</p>

<p>“Why do you say ‘Whew!’ in that tone of
voice, Mr. Dennis Fogarty? It isn’t at all a
nice word and it isn’t nice in you to use it.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I’m uneasy, Miss Carlota. A horse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>is a horse an’ there’s no denyin’ that same.”</p>

<p>“Dennis, that fall has made you silly.”</p>

<p>“Very like that’s the truth you be speakin’.
But, for why did he go steal a horse?”</p>

<p>“He never! How can a body ‘steal’ what
belongs to nobody else? At home he often
caught a wild horse out of a herd and broke it
to ride. He’s very—very expertatious that
way, Dennis. My Miguel was terr’ble proud
of him.”</p>

<p>Then, after a moment, she continued:</p>

<p>“I don’t see what made you disturb me when
I was so happy. I wish somebody—But I
won’t wait to wish. I’ll go straight away and
find out what it all means. I <i>will</i> see my
brother. I <i>will</i> make them bring him out from
wherever he is, for he can’t talk with these
people and I can. Oh! how glad I am I
learned, even if only a little bit!”</p>

<p>She hastily left him to his lonely foreboding,
there upon the roof, which grew unpleasantly
warm as the shadows moved from him.
Scrambling down into the interior of the house
upon which they had been sitting, Carlota
wildly demanded of the first person she met to
be taken to her brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>“I must and shall see him. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Where you will be if you make an uproar.
The council is deliberating.”</p>

<p>That the girl would dare force her presence
upon the elders of the village did not enter the
informant’s mind till she saw Carlota look
frantically around and then dart toward the
nearest opening in the inner wall. This was
not in the direction of the hall of justice, but it
led—somewhere! and through it the child ran,
crying at the top of her voice:</p>

<p>“Carlos! My Carlos! Where are you?”</p>

<p>Then she was confronted by an aged woman,
who caught and almost viciously questioned
her:</p>

<p>“Would you rush before the wise men thus—you?”</p>

<p>“Wise? You mean wicked—wicked! Oh,
my father, my father! Why did we ever leave
Refugio!” and shrieking, she threw herself
prone on the floor and buried her face in her
arms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>BY DIFFERENT TONGUES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Refugio.”</p>

<p>The word was magic. The angry woman
who had laid hand upon Carlota’s shoulder
started at the sound and intently regarded the
unhappy child. Then she stooped and again
touched her, but, this time, with gentle, tremulous
fingers.</p>

<p>“Say that again, <i>Señorita</i>. Again.”</p>

<p>The girl sprang up, for to hear the familiar
Spanish was, also, magic.</p>

<p>“What? Who are you? It was Refugio, I
said. The House of Refuge—which this is not!
Why—why?”</p>

<p>The wrinkled face softened to comeliness,
and a look grew upon it which tempted Carlota
to clasp it between her own two palms, in a
dainty fashion she had, and to beseech:</p>

<p>“Do you know Refugio? Have you ever
been at my home?”</p>

<p>“Are you the Master’s daughter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“Yes, oh! yes. Do you know him? Is he,
too, here?”</p>

<p>The woman shook her head.</p>

<p>“No. Why should he be here? But I know
the place, yes. In my heart of hearts, why
not? And the blessed Lady who died for my
poor son. Pablo, soul of my life, afflicted of
God, Pablo—the natural, where are you this
day!”</p>

<p>“‘Pablo’? The ‘Lady of Refugio’? Then—who
are you?”</p>

<p>Carlota was now upon her knees before the
trembling creature whose memory had been so
strangely stirred. But, at sight of her thus
humbled, the crone herself stood up and set the
child upon a bench. Still standing, she burst
into a rapid story of that which has been
already told: of Pablo’s desperate illness and
his nursing back to health by the all-loving
“Lady of Refugio.” How that name, that
household, was a spell to conjure by; and that
here—if she who had long ago married a
Pueblo had influence—the children of Refugio
should have rich and speedy justice. More:
there could be nothing too good or sacred in the
whole tribe for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“Come, little girl. Let us go. Ah! proud,
proud am I thus once to lay my hand upon the
flesh of her who died to save my son!”</p>

<p>“Is Pablo here?”</p>

<p>“Not now. Sometimes he comes, far, far
between. He is not like others. Against my
father’s will I married and I have been punished,
yes. Against his will and against the
faith I had been taught by the good Padres.
I was happy, why not? Till my husband, a
brave, fell dead in the field, gored by one of his
own cattle. My son is happier than I, for he
knows neither sin nor its punishment. But,
come. I can still be of use. Come.”</p>

<p>The councilors were amazed by the intrusion
of old Paula and her charge, but listened respectfully
to her story and her plea. She was
reputed to be very wise and was known to be a
most excellent nurse. True, those hardy Pueblos
rarely required nursing, yet, when they
did, it were well to be friends with her who
ministered to them. The dose might be wrong
if the giver were offended.</p>

<p>When she ceased speaking Carlos was immediately
brought out of his dark room and set
in the midst; and to see the twins rush, sobbing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
yet laughing, into each other’s arms touched
even those stolid Indians and inclined some to
lenient judgment.</p>

<p>Yet, it was the eldest man speaking, and he
must be heard:</p>

<p>“Brothers, he stole our horse. From our
own wild herd. We have been greatly harassed.
Punishment is just. If we make not
example of the bird in the hand, how deal with
the bird uncaught? There is peace between us
and our white brothers but—our white brothers
still steal our horses. This youth is swift
of aim; he is proud; a Pueblo of whom to say:
‘Behold, a brave!’ His father—” a suggestive
shrug of the shoulders intimated that this
unknown father was recreant and had deserted
his offspring. “Let him be to us a son and she
our daughter. This is my wisdom.”</p>

<p>Then the council gravely laid the matter
before the youthful prisoner and listened
closely to his simple reply, which, acting as
interpreters, old Paula and Carlota eagerly
translated.</p>

<p>“On my father’s rancho are many herds of
horses. All are wild. I did not ask to whom
they belonged. When I wished I sought one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
as I did from yours. I have been taught the
art. I am not a thief. I, I would not have
‘stolen,’ no. Not if I walked all the days of
my life. But I thought the free creatures of
the plains were God’s, alone. Well, then; if
I did wrong I will take punishment, as should
the son of man who is brave. After you have
done your will I will go. Nothing can make me
stay. My father has not forever left his children.
Since he comes not it is because, for
some reason I do not know, that he cannot.
My sister and I will go to him, and tell him this
story. He will restore what is due. I owe
nothing to anyone except good will, and that I
will pay as I may. Moreover—<i>you still have
the horse—and I broke him for you</i>.”</p>

<p>The naive conclusion of the argument was
so consistent with the childish pleader that
some of those stern judges smiled. After all,
he was but a boy and he spoke the truth; and
the old chief who would have liked to rear the
youngster as his own was even more desirous
now. But he was just, and it was he who first
extended the hand-clasp of peace.</p>

<p>Radiant with joy at their dismissal, the twins
left the hall of justice and returned where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
had left Dennis. He had vanished, yet, while
they were searching the many roofs they heard
his voice in one of the courtyards below.</p>

<p>“Hark! The foolish fellow! He imagines
that hallooing so loud will make them understand
him as well as if he knew their language!”
said Carlota, with a little air of
superiority. Indeed! Where would they
have been now if she hadn’t been able to talk
with old Paula?</p>

<p>“Ha, Carlota! I’m learning some lessons,
too, of another sort—these days. I’ll lasso
no more horses till I know whose they are!
But, come on! It’s so good to be free again
and Dennis is surely getting into trouble.
Why, what’s the matter with his arm?”</p>

<p>As they descended to the court and the Irishman,
Carlota explained. He was now trying
to “swop” with a young Indian; his broncho
for a pack-burro.</p>

<p>“Hurry! Tell them, sister! He’ll make
them mad, directly, and—I don’t wish any
more Pueblo anger, if you please! It wasn’t
of the noisy kind but—I’ll be glad when we’re
once more on the road toward our father, and
I wish we hadn’t to go back to the Burnhams.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
While I was alone in that horrible darkness, I
did a lot of thinking, and I believe that father
went to the big city of New York, where the
‘enemies’ came from, on some business for the
rich men who own the mountains he ‘prospected.’
Anyway, I think that’s where we’d
best seek him.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a far, far place? Is it in the
‘north’?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But we can go and go, day after day,
can’t we?”</p>

<p>“I—I s’pose so,” she slowly answered.</p>

<p>But this “wild goose chase” was losing its
charm for Carlota, and she now often thought
of the Captain’s opinion that they should never
have left home, unless bidden to do so by a
wiser man than Miguel.</p>

<p>However, here was Dennis, forgetting his
trading operations in delight at reunion with
Carlos; and here, too, was unusual commotion
among the villagers. Because Paula would
insist that this should be a <i>fiesta</i>, a day of merry
frivolity, such as suited her Mexican nature,
which age had not wholly altered.</p>

<p>The children’s impatience at delay was overruled.
Indeed, the affair proved to be one to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
forever remembered, for the <i>fiesta</i> lasted more
than three days; so that it was well along in
the morning of the fourth day before the guests
for whom the holiday was made were allowed
to depart. Even then, they did not go alone.
Two young men acted as guides to direct them
whither the Burnhams had probably encamped.
Paula, also, went; riding an ancient and most
sedate burro, as black as her own hair that
even yet had not a thread of white mixed in it.</p>

<p>When they had been bidden a last, grave
farewell by the assembled Pueblos, the children
were led out upon the terrace and there a fresh
surprise awaited them.</p>

<p>“What is this? Why—what?” asked Carlota,
her eyes shining with anticipation, for, by
the instincts of her own generous heart, she
already guessed the truth.</p>

<p>Paula laughed, like one who had suddenly
regained her youth, and answered gayly:</p>

<p>“One wouldn’t wish the mouse-colored,
blazed-face burro die of loneliness by the way,
is it not?”</p>

<p>“Tell me, quick, quick! Oh! Paula, tell!”</p>

<p>“That grown up baby, Dennis! Soul of
my life, what has he to do with a horse? A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
pack-donkey is even too good for one who
would run a friend through with a knife, yes.”</p>

<p>“But the beautiful horse, Paula, what of
him?”</p>

<p>“Shall one of the Master’s children ride and
not the other? ’Tis a fine animal, he chose
well from the wildings, and he conquered the
wildness well. It befits that to the finder the
spoils. So the council now decree. <i>Ha!</i> ’Tis
a proud, handsome lad; he they would have
made a Pueblo brave! I—I wish—if my poor
Pablo—?”</p>

<p>Carlota’s arms were around the old mother’s
neck and she was kissing away the gloom
which rested on the wrinkled face, crying:</p>

<p>“Ah! dear Paula! You have been so good to
us! Up in her Heaven my happy mother must
know and love you for the help you have given
her straying children. And we will find him,
that Pablo you love. Miguel and many shall
hunt for him everywhere, and when he is found
he shall be led to you here. Believe me, he
shall. And for the rest—thank you, thank
you, thank you!”</p>

<p>“In truth then, should I die in peace. If he
were here he would be safe. The Pueblos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
honor the ‘touched of God.’ Alas! the <i>Americanos</i>
taunt and jeer them.”</p>

<p>“Believe me. I feel—I know—he will come
back to you some day, and soon.”</p>

<p>Gayly, they rode forward all that day and
toward sunset had come so far into the mountains
that the guides could clearly point their
further route. They halted in a beautiful spot,
where there was abundant water and verdure,
and they had their packs well-filled by their recent
hosts. Yet, with the deep emotions of
those who live close to nature, they long lingered
over the parting; and even Dennis, on his
new and quiet mount, appeared thoughtful and
serious. He seemed either to have adopted the
silence of his Indian escort or to be afflicted by
the prospect of another journey into unknown
places and dangers.</p>

<p>Carlota had her botany-box piled with her
other belongings upon her burro, and though
Carlos had left his own cherished hammer in
the Burnham’s wagon, he had been given another
of Indian shaping which, because of its
flint-stone head, he thought far superior. Said
Carlota, as she sat down by the old woman on
a boulder:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>“You see, Paula, we, too, are ‘prospecting,’
same as our father did. The good Burnhams
hope to find some traces somewhere of gold, or
silver, or something else that would mean
money. I know many sorts of flowers that
bloom in mining lands. That is, I know about
them, for my father told me. He showed me
pictures, too, that he himself had painted. I
could tell the real ones in a minute, if I only
could find some. Then Mr. Burnham could
pay back to the rich old lady, that lives away
off, all the debt he owes her and that he calls
his ‘life’s burden.’ We would be doing good
if we could help him, and to do good is all it’s
worth living for, my father says.”</p>

<p>“Would that I might see him! That blessed
Master.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you will. When you come to Refugio,
as we planned.”</p>

<p>Paula sighed. Then she caught up the little
brown hand and laid it against her own, far
browner from age and wrinkled like a shriveled
fruit.</p>

<p>“To the grave is far, when one is young, but
the way is short for me. However, is it flowers
and gold? <i>Hola!</i> There is far better in these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
mountains. My husband often told me.
Sometimes, also, he would bring me a bit of
that stuff. With it he would make a brave fire,
great heat and dancing flames. Ah! yes. He
should be rich, he said; then he would take me
back to my birth-town and we would sport it
with the best. Then the cruel bull gored him
to death and here am I. Ah! life is strange,
but death is stranger. Else, had my husband,
who was wise, have lived; and the son who
knows naught but—”</p>

<p>More to divert the woman’s thoughts than
because she had really heeded what had been
said, Carlota begged for a further talk about
the wondrous “stuff” which would burn and
warm old blood to youth again and which
painted flame-pictures for men to see.</p>

<p>“<i>Ay de mi.</i><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Cared I for that? Well, then,
for love I had left that birth-town and with
love I was content. Nothing else mattered.
I—a woman is so foolish! Dearer to me were
the flowers my husband brought and thrust in
my dark hair than the ugly black stuff he
burned.”</p>

<p>Paula observed that the young men had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
turned their faces homeward and were impatiently
waiting for her to join them. They
dared not hasten her by words, for their tribe
held age in honor, and she was held to be wise
beyond most. But she would delay just a bit
longer and amuse the pretty child who begged
a tale of a flower; then farewell! forever.</p>

<p>“What color had those blossoms, Paula? If
red or yellow they must have been brave in
your dark hair. Tell me, so that when I find
one I can say: ‘This is for dear Paula,’ and
put it in my own curls—if it will stay there.”</p>

<p>The woman laughed, well pleased.</p>

<p>“Will you, <i>niña</i>? I love you, for your own
sweet face and because you are your mother’s
child. The flowers? <i>Si.</i> Wear them, wear
them, always. They are better for you than
for me. They are blue and fit well your fairness.
Blue and shaped—thus.”</p>

<p>She took a small leaf and with deft, love-taught
fingers fashioned a simple model which,
to the plant-wise Carlota, suggested a blossom
she could readily identify. Then she swiftly
rose and clasped the child in her arms, saying:</p>

<p>“<i>Adios</i>, beloved, sun-gleam on a darkened
life. May angels go with each step on the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
until the father you miss shall clasp you close
again. <i>Adios!</i>”</p>

<p>The little girl felt a desolate heart-sinking
as the three Pueblos almost immediately disappeared.
Then she reproached herself for tears,
since Carlos was with her, safe and free, and
now the jubilant possessor of a beautiful horse
that was, in truth, “almost as handsome as Benoni,”
and which was, hereafter, to bear that
beloved creature’s own name though he could
never take the old Benoni’s place.</p>

<p>There was nothing to fear, now. The guides
had taught Dennis how to draw the tethers
around a bit of ground in such a manner as to
keep all reptiles from intruding upon this circular
space where the wanderers would safely
sleep. Carlota began to watch the Irishman at
his labors and, idly, to study the ground he enclosed.
A last ray of sunlight stole through
the branches overhead and touched to glory a
bit of herbage almost at her very feet.
Touched one fragment of it that, seeing, the
child was thrilled to intense surprise and stared
so long and so fixedly, that, at last, Carlos teasingly
cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“Why, little sister, you look as if you were
seeing ghosts!”</p>

<p>With a little gasp she aroused from her revery
and answered very gravely:</p>

<p>“Carlos, I believe I am!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

<small>AT THE POINT OF DEATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Carlota was awakened by the sun shining
upon her face and Connemara nibbling at her
curls. She sprang up, confused by her new
surroundings, then laughed aloud at the beauty
of the morning. The loneliness of the last
evening had vanished and she was ready for
whatever might come. First, for a frolic with
Carlos or Dennis.</p>

<p>These two yet lay sleeping, their feet toward
the ashes of their bedtime fire and their heads
almost touching the ring of prickly, horsehair
ropes which marked out their tiny camp; and
over which, the Pueblos had assured them, no
reptile of delicate skin would crawl.</p>

<p>In a mood to tease, Carlota now picked up
these tethers and started to bind her brother’s
hands with them. The first touch roused him
and, finding what she would be at, he entered
so noisily into the fun that Dennis, also, awoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“Whist! to ye. Sure, now’s not the time to
be stirrin’ yet, is it?”</p>

<p>“Quite time, good Dennis. How is the arm?
How did you sleep? Did you hear any of the
wild beasts that you imagined were going to
surround us?”</p>

<p>“Never a one did I, but a thankful man I’ll
be, more by token, when I feels a good roof
overhead once more. Not an Injun roof but a
fine Christian sort. Arrah musha! ’Tis a
load, is this barrowful o’ mud them queer people
have piled on me arm, so it is!”</p>

<p>“Dennis! Dennis, the Grumbler! If it
wasn’t a ‘good Christian roof’ you’ve slept under
these last few nights, I don’t know what
you’d call one. You went to that pueblo with
murder in your heart and its owners treated
you—splendidly. They fed you, nursed you,
and mended you—bones and clothes. For you
were a rough sight, my Dennis, till Paula sewed
up the rips you’d given your grand attire in
struggling with Cork. Poor Cork! to be
‘swopped’ for a—mule!”</p>

<p>“Sure, a burro’s no mule. A burro’s a donkey;
an’ a donkey is a sweet little beast, like
they have in old Ireland. But the creatur’s no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
name, so that job must be done over again, belike.”</p>

<p>“Oh! if you ‘swopped’ animals, you must
have ‘swopped’ names. I got Carlota to ask
and this one’s name is a wicked one, Dennis,
it’s ‘<i>Diablo</i>,’” said Carlos.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, I know, I was hearin’ that
same but I’ll not have it. No, indeed. Troth,
no name at all is better nor a bad one.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. Call him ‘Captain’ after the
real Captain who was so kind to us. I’m
afraid he isn’t a good tempered beast, but that
doesn’t matter. He’ll have plenty of work to
do, here in the mountains, and—I’m hungry!
Dennis, shall I wash your face for you, or can
you do it for yourself with your well hand?”
asked Carlota.</p>

<p>“Wash me face! Wash—me—face? An’
sure is it dirty?”</p>

<p>“Dirty? Of course, it is. Haven’t you been
asleep? Isn’t it morning? Doesn’t everybody
need to freshen themselves after sleeping?
I don’t think you’re really awake yet.”</p>

<p>“Arrah musha! But I’m more nor wide
awake enough than to be lettin’ the likes o’
yourself do such a service for the poor lad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
from Connemara. Och! the purty thackeen!”</p>

<p>Fortunately the broken arm was not the right
one, therefore Dennis could do most needful
things for himself and soon grew so “handy
with one hand” that he also did much for the
others.</p>

<p>All during their happy and simple breakfast
which they ate by the spring, Carlos observed
his sister’s eyes continually roving
over the ground and, finally, he asked:</p>

<p>“For what are you looking, girlie? Have
you lost anything?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and no. I’m looking for something I
thought I saw, last night. Something about
which old Paula told me. I was sure I saw
it—one—just after she went away; but, I
don’t see it now, and maybe I only dreamed
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’ve finished breakfast we must
be off. I’m afraid the Burnhams will think
we are lost, for good.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we were!” said Carlota, mysteriously.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You said ‘lost for good.’ It may prove the
best kind of good to them and everybody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>“I don’t see how,” returned the lad, who
hated “riddles.”</p>

<p>“By and by, I’ll tell you—if there’s anything
to tell. I’m keeping my eyes open, as our
father bade us. He said that the habit of observing
everything and calling nothing a trifle—Why,
sometimes some of the little bits of
things led up to the very, very biggest ones.
It was a little thing Paula told me about, and
I’m watching for it.”</p>

<p>“And I’m on the watch for the camp! Come
on. I’ll put all the saddles on. They’re a
nuisance. I’d rather ride without any, only
it didn’t seem polite to say so when the Pueblos
gave them to us.”</p>

<p>“But, brother, they’re not much of saddles.
Not like that Dennis gave away with Cork.
They’re soft and blanket-y like, and I guess
we’re more comfortable with them. Which
way, first?”</p>

<p>“Right on and up the canyon. The Indians
said that it leads to some mining camps, and
they thought we might find the Burnhams there.
Or, anyway, hear news of them, if any of the
miners have seen them. If there are any miners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
left. If—if—if! I’m tired of ‘ifs,’ so
let’s hurry on!”</p>

<p>They set off, at once. They divided their
simple luggage among them, the twins insisting
that the disabled Dennis should take but
the lightest portion upon his burro. Carlos
rode first, leading the way and having some
trouble with his new Benoni. Dennis followed
next and Carlota last, that she might look out
for him. For as she said, with a laugh:</p>

<p>“A broken-armed man must be handled with
care! And, aren’t you glad you learned to ride
Cork, first? If you hadn’t learned when you
were well, you could hardly have managed to
do so now.”</p>

<p>“True for ye. But if this ain’t the road that
beats all! Faith, here’s more stones nor ever
I saw in me life!”</p>

<p>Indeed, that canyon was a rough place, and
they followed toward its source the brawling
stream that ran through it. Sometimes they
were in the water, sometimes out of it. Sometimes
they had to cling to the precipitous sides,
leaving their animals to their own devices.
Again, though rarely, they would reach a freer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
space, where were myriads of flowers and tree-shaded
nooks. They ate their mid-day meal at
one such spot and here, for the first time, they
found traces of other human beings.</p>

<p>Carlota was poking about among the blooming
plants, scrutinizing each and selecting
“specimens” for her box, when she caught
sight of something blue and small.</p>

<p>“The flower! The flower!” she cried and
ran to gather it.</p>

<p>But it was no flower. It was a torn scrap of
coarse blue gingham.</p>

<p>At her cry, Dennis rushed forward. He
was, as they told him, “centipede mad,” and,
at any unusual sound, his instant thought was
of peril from the creeping thing.</p>

<p>“Where is it? Where? Wait till I beats
the life out o’ him, the nasty beast!”</p>

<p>She waved the bit of cloth before his eyes
and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“The tie-before o’ the little gossoon!”</p>

<p>“What? What is it?” asked Carlos, running
forward.</p>

<p>“Teddy!” answered his sister, holding out
the scrap of cloth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>“It is! Surely. Yet—that wasn’t torn to-day.
It’s been hanging there a good while.
See the edges.”</p>

<p>Carlota’s heart sank, as she replied:</p>

<p>“When I saw it I thought we had only to call
out and they would hear us. I almost fancied
I could see the little fellow’s face peeping at me
from the very bush. Anyway, we must be on
the right road and that does make it easier to
go on.”</p>

<p>It did, indeed. Each felt a renewed patience
for the toilsome search, though they were not
immediately to come upon any further trace of
the family they sought. That night they slept
within a rocky cove and Dennis dreamed of
hobgoblins and “phookas,” galore. His
snores and outcries were so constant and disturbing
that before daylight fairly came, all
were awake and ready to move on.</p>

<p>The fact was that poor Dennis was growing
feverish and somewhat light headed. His arm,
in its heavy dressings, was painful and exceedingly
heavy. His great boots cumbered him.
He was homesick and full of forebodings; and,
as the morning advanced, the twins felt seriously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
alarmed. When they pressed him to
take some food, he peevishly declined it, protesting:</p>

<p>“No. I don’t want it. Take it away. Yes,
I know, I know. Eatin’s fine for them that
likes it. Not for me. Arrah musha! We’ll
never find they we are seekin’. When I left
Mr. Grady, ‘Dennis,’ says he, ‘you’re crazy,’
says he. ‘Ye’ll die in them mountains,’ says
he, ‘an’ what’ll I do for a neighbor to wrastle
with, when home we goes to old Ireland an’
yourself dead,’ says he. Troth, that same was
the truth he was speakin’.”</p>

<p>Carlota was at her wits’ end. Dennis obstinately
refused to touch any food or to go onward
another step.</p>

<p>“Dennis, Dennis! How silly to talk about
a dead man’s wrestling! and Dennis Fogarty!
how <i>mean</i> to go and die—die—right in sight,
almost, of our journey’s end! I thought you
loved your ‘little lady,’ dear Dennis. Do you
s’pose my Miguel would do anything so—so
disappointing as to go and die, just because
he wouldn’t eat, if I didn’t want him to? No.
In truth! He’d live a hundred years, first, like
old Guadalupo. He would so!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>A faint fire flashed in the tired eyes of the
ex-trackman. He had quite decided to die.
He felt, that under existing circumstances, life
was too much to expect of any man. “Little
lady?” Yes. Of course he loved her. She
needn’t persist in taunting him with that
wretched “Greaser.” Besides, anyhow, she
had Carlos. They were all in all to each other,
those two. They didn’t need him. His work
was done. He had vindicated his manliness.
He was very ill. Arrah musha! Very ill, indeed.
Still, in the approved western style, he
would “die with his boots on.” But he would,
he wanted to, they needn’t—</p>

<p>“Look out! The lion—the lion!”</p>

<p>“Bang! Bang! Bang-bang-BANG!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>CAMP BURNHAM</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Never came mortal back to life so suddenly
as Dennis! He was the first on his feet. His
yells were keyed to a pitch and volume that
would have terrified any lion which ever
roamed the forest, and especially that timid,
sneaking creature which assumes the name of
a nobler animal. From the tree above the cowardly
beast looked down upon the group. Its
eyes gleamed wickedly, yet its whole lithe body
quivered in fear, for it had been pursued to its
own destruction.</p>

<p>“Bang! R-r-r-rip—flash—BANG!”</p>

<p>It fell at their very feet, so to speak, and then
did Dennis believe that his hour had really
come.</p>

<p>“Och! murder! me soul! That ever I
should have lived—to die!” and, almost paralyzed
by fright he, too, fell down.</p>

<p>With a mutual impulse of protection, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
children clung together, too startled for speech;
and it was not until the lion, or puma, had been
lifeless for some seconds that they released
each other and peered into the forest whence
the shot had come. Thence now, also, came the
crashing of branches and soon there hurried
into view—Mr. Burnham!</p>

<p>He paused, as astonished as they; then, with
a shout of delight, the trio rushed together.</p>

<p>“Oh! have we found you?”</p>

<p>“Dear children! I might have killed you
when I fired! How came you here?”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t. You only killed the lion.
Where are the rest? Is everybody well? Mrs.
Burnham? Teddy? And Jack? Are you
camping near? Can we go now? Did you
think we were lost? Oh! we have been—but—”</p>

<p>Nobody thought of Dennis, for a moment,
and he still lay, fancying himself dying. Then
he heard the voices. One seemed strangely
familiar, yet he was powerless to move till the
station-master comprehended who it was that
lay huddled beside the dead puma, and called:</p>

<p>“Dennis! Dennis, are you hurt, lad?”</p>

<p>The ex-trackman groaned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>“Why—is it so? That’s bad, indeed!
Where are you wounded? Did I shoot you, or
that creature spring upon you?”</p>

<p>“Och! I’m dead. I’m dead, entirely.”</p>

<p>“Guess not. Try to get up. Why, what’s
the matter here, with your arm? This is no
beast-scratch.”</p>

<p>Both at once, the twins rapidly told their
story and, by his own wit, the newcomer
learned the main facts. He was very sorry for
Dennis but felt that the Irishman’s present collapse
was due to fear and disappointment,
rather than approaching death. He remembered
that among the traits of his old employee
was a fondness for good food, so urged:</p>

<p>“Come on, my fine fellow. The mistress is
cooking such a supper yonder, in our little
camp, as will put new life into your ‘dead’
limbs—instanter! Brook trout—broiled on
wood coals; fresh biscuits; wild honey that
Jack found in a tree; with cresses from the
same stream that furnished the trout. How’s
that? Come. Get up. I’ll help you. What
a beautiful horse! Both burros yours? Ah!
I recall—the Pueblos. Well, I must go. Letitia
will be anxious. Every time any of us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
move, now, she fears we’re going forever.
Come to supper, Dennis?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, I know. Thanky, but—I
couldn’t. No, I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Suit yourself. I’ll lead your
donkey forward and you follow when you
choose.”</p>

<p>Carlota was distressed and looked anxiously
into Mr. Burnham’s face; then caught a
twinkle in his eye which belied his apparent
indifference.</p>

<p>“What will you do about the puma?” asked
Carlos, somewhat envious of the fine shooting
which had brought down the animal.</p>

<p>“Leave it for the present. Its skin is worth
coming back for but the good news of your return
mustn’t be kept from the others any
longer. Come, all of you.”</p>

<p>“This way? Straight ahead?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Where you see the trail divide—beyond
that tree—a fork of it goes down into
what appears to be a ‘bottomless pit.’ I have
explored the gulch for a little distance, but
found no traces of anything I sought. Thus
far—it’s all been seeking and no finding,” finished
Mr. Burnham, with a sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>“Well, it’s only such a little while. Not
many days yet.”</p>

<p>“No, lad, but they’ve seemed long to my wife.
Your safe return will put new life and courage
into us all.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” cheerfully responded Carlota.</p>

<p>But Carlos was silent. For them both and
without consulting her again, he had decided
that, after a brief stop with their friends, they
would resume their own interrupted journey
toward the “north” and the father they must
find. Mr. Burnham observed the boy’s silence
but made no comment on it, and they started
onward through the canyon leading the animals,
for riding was both perilous and uncomfortable.
They had speedily left the smooth
glade where they had rested and met, and now
the canyon walls rose sheer and almost impassable.</p>

<p>Carlota continually looked back and, at a moment
when they paused to take breath, she
whispered to her brother:</p>

<p>“I can’t bear to leave good, kind Dennis
there, alone. Maybe he is really dying! I
must go back and see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>Carlos, also, peered into the dimness behind
and nudged her. A creeping, awkward figure
was following them, in a shame-faced way, as
if unwilling to acknowledge his own mistaken
statements—honest Dennis, very much alive!</p>

<p>“Poor fellow! He was really sick and feverish,
terribly tired, and homesick for even such
a place as Leopard or Tuttle—any spot where
there were ‘Christian roofs’ and white-skinned
people. As Paula called him, he’s but a grown
up baby, after all. You mustn’t laugh at him,
brother dear, when he comes up with us, nor
act as if you remembered a bit of his foolishness.
Promise.”</p>

<p>“All right, Carlota. I don’t promise—, but
I’ll take care.”</p>

<p>So they went gayly on again, and it was the
sound of their happy voices which brought
mother and sons running down the slope from
Camp Burnham to meet them. Letitia and
Carlota clasped and reclasped one another,
half-laughing, half-crying, and at first, too
deeply moved for speech. But grave little
Teddy neither laughed nor cried. He merely
observed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“Muvver, she did find the piece of my ap’on
what I tored. She has got it in her jacket.
Now you can mend it.”</p>

<p>Then Carlota turned about and saw him
standing, arms akimbo, in all the dignity of his
first, rough little “camping-twousers,” calm
and unruffled, as if being lost and found again
were but an ordinary incident of the day.</p>

<p>“You darling! Have you missed me?
Missed your ‘new sister,’ Carlota?”</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>“O, Teddy! Why haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Been a-fishin’. Catched a fish an’ cooked
him. Teddy’s hungwy. Come to supper.”</p>

<p>Happy Mrs. Burnham seconded the request:</p>

<p>“Yes, come to supper, everybody! After
that for a nice long talk, and everything told
that’s befallen you from the moment you left
us till this. But, Jack? Why, where’s Jack?”</p>

<p>He came, slipping and sliding down the
steep behind the little clearing where they had
pitched their tent, and where the white
“schooner” now did duty as storehouse and
general utility apartment.</p>

<p>“Hello! Master-cut-and-come-again! So
you’re back? Well, I’m glad of it. Need you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
to help forage. Never saw such appetites as
my relatives have. Father spends his time
tapping and digging around in the ground, and
the cares of providing fresh ‘butcher’s meat,’
fresh fish, fresh fruit, fresh water, fresh everything—devolves
upon yours truly. Say, I
wish you’d sell me that lasso of yours. I need
it. Honor bright. What’ll you take? Oh,
Carlota? You here? Howdy.”</p>

<p>The overjoyed lad affected his usual indifference,
yet, as he threw upon the ground before
them the results of his afternoon with the rod
and line, and his father’s second-hand shot-gun,
his honest pride made his homely features good
to see.</p>

<p>“Where’s my Dennis?” suddenly demanded
Teddy.</p>

<p>“Coming, yonder. Run and meet him and
tell him how glad you are to have him back,”
suggested Carlota.</p>

<p>Without comment, Teddy obeyed, and
promptly brought the last member of the party
to enjoy that famous supper. Nor, though
they sat late around the camp-fire, exchanging
confidences, did anybody mention the possibility
of “dying.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br>

<small>THE BLUE FLOWER AND THE BLACK ROCK</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Yes, go, my dear, I don’t want you to sit
here alone, so constantly, or so continually to
toil for somebody. Oh! you precious comfort!
I should have died here, in the wilderness, but
for your tender care!”</p>

<p>“No, no, Mrs. Burnham. Don’t say that. I
was here and I’ve done what I could. That’s
all. It’s so good to know you are getting better!”
answered Carlota, who was far less rosy
and gay than when, so many weeks before, she
had reached Camp Burnham, where they still
remained.</p>

<p>On the morning after her arrival, Carlota
had been awakened by a cry of alarm, and,
half-aroused, had seen Mrs. Burnham unsteadily
leaning against the wagon-end. A second
later, the cry of pain was repeated and she saw
the woman fall; and from that moment until
now life had seemed a terrible dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>The frail Letitia, upon whose cheerful self-sacrifice
rested everybody’s comfort, had suddenly
collapsed. An old weakness of the heart
had returned to strike her down at a moment,
when it seemed to her, she could less be spared
than ever before.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve had to lie still. There was no
help for it; and again, my dear, I say that I believe
God sent you to me when you came. Inexperienced
child though you were, your devotion
and care have saved me.”</p>

<p>A bed of pine boughs within a tent may not
be the most luxurious of couches, yet had Mrs.
Burnham chosen from all the world she could
scarcely have selected a spot more conducive to
recovery from such an illness. She now continued,
looking around upon all her dear ones,
clustered before the opening of her tent:</p>

<p>“You have done your helpful share, each one.
But I am really much, much stronger, and I
want Carlota to go off with her brother for a
long, delightful day by themselves. Her berry-brown
face is getting bleached by staying
indoors—even in a canvas indoors—till it almost
matches her hair. That won’t do. Besides,
since we haven’t found here what we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
sought, we must move on again very soon.
This lovely spot has grown to be like home to
me but—there are others just as fair.”</p>

<p>“Oh! maybe Mr. Burnham will find his ‘lucky
stone’ right here,” said Carlota, radiant at
thought of a long quiet day “by themselves”
with her precious brother. She knew, too, by
the way he looked at her, lately, that he had
something especial to say to her and only
waited an opportunity to say it. So, taking a
little luncheon with her and promising that
they would surely come back before dark, the
girl set off to find her brother, lounging on the
rocks below.</p>

<p>“Oh! how nice it is to be alone, quite by our
two selves! They are so good to us, and yet—I—Carlos,
do you ever think of Refugio now?”</p>

<p>“Think of it? All the time, almost. I’m
as glad as you to come by ourselves, for we
must have a talk. First—which way shall we
go?”</p>

<p>“Down the canyon to the bend in it and that
other terrible rocky fork of it. I saw something.
Oh! I saw something!” said Carlota,
mysteriously.</p>

<p>With their arms about each other’s shoulders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
they gayly ran to that strange rift in the
mountain side, which disclosed its heart of
rock. There they sat down upon a jutting
boulder to gaze into the awful depths.</p>

<p>“It’s the most—most fascination place I
ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! Fascinating is what you mean.
You quite make me ashamed, sometimes, Carlota,
when you forget to be proper in your
speech.”</p>

<p>She accepted the reproof with perfect good
humor:</p>

<p>“Do I? That’s too bad. But never mind it
now. Carlos, do you see anything—very wonderful—down
in that—abyss? Is that the
right word, darling?”</p>

<p>Not being himself sure he evaded the question.</p>

<p>“It’s the strangest canyon I ever saw.
Looks as if some mighty giants had taken monstrous
sledge-hammers and split the mountain
in two. As if all its insides were those curious,
dark stones. But such giants, Carlota!
They must have been able to reach to the sky;
and their hammers would, surely, have weighed
a thousand thousand tons!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>“O, Carlos! They couldn’t be so big!”</p>

<p>“Did I say they were? I said—do pay
attention, Carlota, and not stare down there
so! If you had more imag—imagernation,
little sister, you would have more enjoyment.”</p>

<p>“Would I? Seems you aren’t ‘talking’
much, only finding out things I ought to do.
Carlos, I’m going down to the bottomest bottom
of that place!” and, leaning forward, she
pointed toward the awful chasm.</p>

<p>“Hmm. Then I guess we’d best begin to
talk. Say, dear, we can go away now, to find
our father.”</p>

<p>“When? And leave poor Mrs. Burnham?”</p>

<p>“Right away. The very next to-morrow
that’s coming. She’s ’most well; she says so;
and besides, though you didn’t know it, they
are nearly out of food and have no money to
buy more—even if there were a place to buy it
in.” His voice was dramatically earnest.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s all that heap and heap of
cans.”</p>

<p>“Empty, Carlota. <i>All empty!</i>”</p>

<p>“They can’t be. They’re standing up all
tight and straight in that cool place by the
spring. I saw Mr. Burnham fix them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>“Dear, that was to deceive his wife. True.
The cans are empty. We’re everyone of us so
hungry except her, you see, and we’ve eaten
and eaten! There wasn’t much to begin with;
and he knows that if she thought there was
danger of the food giving out it would kill her.
She is so very weak. There are the fish, but
fish three times a day! I’d like a chicken,
wouldn’t you, Carlota? Or a loaf of Marta’s
bread?”</p>

<p>“Don’t, please don’t, brother! I’m so—so—terr’ble
homesick!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that, even now, Mr. Burnham
thinks his wife will never live to go out of these
mountains. He’s all discouraged. Last night
he said to Jack, that if something wasn’t done
soon we’d all starve. So <i>we</i> must go away.
We’ll find our father, or if not him quick
enough, then somebody else who’ll send them
help. Wasn’t it a pity they ever left Tuttle?
There they had enough to eat and, pleasant as
it is here, they were near folks. Mountains
are nice, but, Carlota, I like folks best.”</p>

<p>“Well, so do I. But I love mountains, too.
I love—I guess I love everything there is.
And I’m going down into that canyon—if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
can. Come with me, because I see something!
I see—something—and if we go away it is
my last chance. I promised Paula—Come.
Let’s. Now.”</p>

<p>He was willing, for care sat lightly upon
him, as upon her; and in another moment both
had forgotten it entirely. For their inspection
of the chasm was hastened by an accident
which drove all other matters out of mind.</p>

<p>There was, apparently, an easy point of
descent a few yards from where they had been
sitting, peering over the abyss. Intermingling
grasses and shrubs grew at the top, upon seemingly
solid ground; but as they touched it, still
walking hand in hand, it gave way beneath
their weight and they felt themselves slipping,
sliding, sinking—they knew not whither.</p>

<p>Carlota’s face blanched, but she did not cry
out. Probably, she did not realize the extent
of their danger as her brother did, for he had
grown more familiar with the region and knew
how full it was of “man-traps” and hidden
perils. Yet, at the first instant of danger, his
heroism roused:</p>

<p>“Don’t fear, Carlota! Try—to slide—slow—hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
yourself—back—keep hold of me—and—<i>Say
your prayers, quick!</i>”</p>

<p>God does not desert those who put their
trust in him. The children reached the end of
that terrible slide in safety. The whole downward
passage had been made smooth for them,
as it were, by the bed of a once rapid waterfall.
Into this channel had now washed dirt, seeded
with the rich vegetation of the spot. The
seeds had found still a little moisture, had
sprung to life, and had thus prepared a natural
carpet over which the imperilled ones passed
to the bottom. But, even thus, their fall was
so sudden and swift that, for some time after
it was over they lay crouched and breathless,
failing to realize that they were still unhurt.</p>

<p>Then they looked up and shuddered! At
any other point they would, inevitably, have
been torn or mangled. But Carlota’s faith
was not disturbed by this, which her brother
saw and suggested.</p>

<p>“But—it <i>wasn’t</i> at any other point, Carlos!
It wasn’t. It was just right there where we
would be safe. God knew. He took all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
care. And—Carlos! Carlos, see there! <i>See
there!</i>”</p>

<p>She forgot her shaken nerves and trembling
limbs as she now sprang to her feet and eagerly
pointed forward.</p>

<p>“Well, what, dear? I see nothing but a
patch of queer blue blossoms. You are flower-crazy,
I do believe. Was it for them you
wanted to come down?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, oh! yes. Why—don’t you yet
understand? It is old Paula’s flower! That
always grows where the black stuff is; the
stuff which makes a flame and warms the people!
See! There’s some of the stone, too.
Oh! joy, joy! We’ve found what our father
said was as good and benefaction-y as any gold
mine! What he was trying to find for the rich
men. This is the flower he told me of, the
same kind that Paula knew. Where it grows—Break
off some of the black rock, brother!
Quick! Then let’s get back to the top. We’ve
found a mine! <i>We—have—found—a—Mine!</i>”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI<br>

<small>IN THE HOSPITAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>In a private room of a New York hospital,
a pale, pain-worn man lay resting upon his
pillows. The surgeons said that he was almost
fit for discharge, and there was the gleam of
returning health in his dark eyes and a faint
color in the firm lips beneath the heavy moustache.</p>

<p>He had been looking through his window
toward the western sky, but his thoughts were
not upon it, and he scarcely heard his nurse
when she entered. Ill as he would have
appeared to anybody who had known him in
his vigor, his present state and progress were
satisfactory to her. She announced her
arrival by asking:</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Manuel, have you been sleeping
any?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, no. I’ve just been dreaming,
Miss Burnham. I’m very homesick; very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
restless and anxious to see my children.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. I like to hear my patients
talk like that. It’s a certain sign of improvement
when their interest in things returns.
Such an evidence of strength on your part that,
if you wish, I will read to you whatever you
fancy. I’m sure you are able to listen and
enjoy news now.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I do that for myself? Though the
doctor did forbid me to use my eyes much
yet.”</p>

<p>“Quite right he was. ‘Make haste slowly’
and you’ll not regret it.”</p>

<p>“Haste! when I’ve been here for months!”</p>

<p>“Better for months than for life—or death.
What shall I begin with?” she answered, opening
the evening paper as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Of course, any western, or southwestern,
news first. The nearest home.”</p>

<p>“It’s matter that interests me, also. I’ve a
brother in the southwest; a station-master on
a railway. Some day, when I can, I’m going
out to see him. Ha! Here’s something. I’m
always attracted by ‘scare headlines,’ and this
article should please you, too, since it’s all
about children and you seem so fond of them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>She let her eyes skim the column then
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“This is a real fairy tale of wonderful happenings
and touches somewhat upon your own
line of business. It is forwarded by a special
correspondent:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Albuquerque, July 17th, 18—. Discovery
of a magnificent mine of the finest anthracite
coal. The discoverers are children under thirteen
years of age.’”</p>
</div>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed the convalescent, with
doubting emphasis.</p>

<p>“The story of this find is as marvellous as
any tale of romance and the childish discoverers
are New Mexican twins. They were born
somewhere on the border of the United States
and Mexico and have always lived there.
Their father is in the business of prospecting,
or locating, mines for a syndicate of wealthy
men, and had trained the children to that
observation of ‘little things’ which he himself
exercised. The little girl knew that a certain
flowering plant grows only where coal is to be
found, and her twin brother had enough knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
of geology to verify the discovery. The
father of the children, Mr. Adrian Manuel—”</p>

<p>The newspaper dropped from the reader’s
hand, and she turned to her patient in swift
alarm. In his still weak state she dreaded the
effect of these unexpected tidings, but he rallied
from the startled silence in which he had
listened, and begged:</p>

<p>“Go on! Oh! go on—go on!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Adrian Manuel had, for some unexplained
reason, left his home for a trip to the
‘north,’ leaving his children in the charge of
his household, supposed to be devoted to him.
Yet, in some manner, the youngsters learned
that some strangers who had come to their
home in their father’s absence were his ‘enemies’
and would either spirit them away from
their home and him, or work them some other
harm. With a faith as great as their ignorance,
they set out to ‘find their father.’
Needless to say that they have failed; though
the publicity given their discovery may, also,
discover the lost parent.</p>

<p>“They have had lots of adventures, have
been in a ‘norther,’ an Apache raid, a Pueblo
village, a visionary miner’s camp, etc., etc.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
Indeed, it was at this last stopping-place, while
under the care of the miner Burnham’s family—”</p>

<p>Again the paper fell. There was a queer
sensation about the nurse’s own heart. Burnham?
Her brother? It might be he!</p>

<p>Mr. Manuel could not wait for her recovery,
but seized the paper and finished the article for
himself, and aloud. He was excited, yet not
hurtfully so. Pride, amazement, infinite gratitude
thrilled in his tones. When he finished
the nurse and her patient could only stare at
one another in silence. Then habit asserted
itself and she sternly inquired:</p>

<p>“Mr. Manuel, did you do this—leave home
without telling your people where you were
going and for what?”</p>

<p>Heretofore, he had been ill, meek and submissive.
Now he had suddenly recovered.
He grew quite bold and self-assertive, and thus
convinced the nurse that he was indeed uninjured
by this first, startling “news from
home.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I now see what a foolish thing it was,
but it didn’t seem so then. There was so much
uncertainty—But I can’t talk! I’m well, and—Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
in the world hasn’t Miguel been here?
Or has he? His letter of instructions, it’s past
time for opening that—I told him he needn’t
write unless trouble happened. I was determined
to recover if human will could aid the
surgeons and I knew that to hear often from
Refugio would tend to make me restless and so
hinder my progress. There was plenty of
money and it is a land where money counts for
less than friendliness.”</p>

<p>“Why hasn’t the manager been here?
Probably because that, after he read your letter,
he realized how much depended on your
peace of mind, which your knowledge of the
children’s loss would utterly destroy. He
loved you too well to kill you outright.”</p>

<p>“But why, then, if my children were in an
Apache outbreak—the men who rescued them—since
they must have been rescued—Oh! it’s
all a dreadful muddle. Somebody should have
put that into the papers—”</p>

<p>“Maybe that was done. How should we
know? You’ve been in hospital for more than
two months. During all that time until to-day
you have neither read for yourself nor listened
to reading. In any case, the advertising columns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
of the daily press are the last things
which I, in my busy life, have time for perusing.
But—about that Burnham. I know he
is my brother. Do you believe he can effect a
claim to any part of that mine? or—oh! I forgot!”</p>

<p>He smiled gayly.</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to forget. I want you to
remember. And—I am going to Albuquerque.
I start to-night. I’ve thought the details out,
already. You are going with me, and on the
same train with the young doctor, that interne,
who has been so faithful and who needs a vacation
almost as badly as you do. The trip will
be glorious. We’ll surprise them all. Our
interests are mutual. I understand all the
red-tapeism of settling the claims to this discovery.
What do you say?”</p>

<p>She was a woman growing old in her beneficent
but toilsome life. The thought of seeing
that distant family to which her heart so often
turned was tempting. Besides, when this
present patient left her care, it would be time
for her vacation. She was resourceful, and
deliberated but a moment.</p>

<p>“Yes. We’ll go. All of us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“That’s good of you. Thus, under the care
of my doctor and my nurse, I can make the trip
in safety, even though I’ve not yet received my
hospital discharge. Well, if we’re going, as
my little Carlota would say—‘Let’s!’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII<br>

<small>IN MY LADY’S CHAMBER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Patterson! Patterson!! Pat-ter—son!!!”</p>

<p>The cane in the old lady’s hand came down
with a thump. It signified: “Attention!”</p>

<p>For a moment or more there was no response
to the summons. Then the irate owner of the
cane bounced out of her chair and rushed about
the room, in a half-frantic manner. She
picked up one article only to toss it aside and
seize another; but all the time, she tightly
clutched the newspaper she held. In her
excitement she had once half-folded the paper
and had then drawn her thin fingers down its
folds as if to make it into a staff or mammoth
taper.</p>

<p>Presently, the door opened and a stout
woman entered this richly furnished bedchamber,
whereupon the old lady rushed toward her
and fairly flourished the paper in the newcomer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
face, who was not a whit disturbed by
the onslaught and calmly advised:</p>

<p>“There, Mrs. Sinclair, that will do. I
wouldn’t go for to put myself in a rage if I was
you. You’d far better sit down and take your
drops.”</p>

<p>“Patterson, where were you?”</p>

<p>“Eating my tea.”</p>

<p>“You’re always ‘eating your tea.’ I wonder
how you manage the feat. It’s one beyond
my wit.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. I dare say it is.”</p>

<p>“Patterson, you are impertinent.”</p>

<p>“Not meanin’ it, ma’am, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“No. You never do mean anything.
That’s the worst of you. If I hadn’t grown so
accustomed to you—You know what would
happen, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. You’ve often told me,” answered
the maid, still undisturbed.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I</i> generally <i>do</i> mean something.
Just now, it’s something which, probably, will
astonish even you—if that is possible.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. I think I could be astonished
if I tried.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I doubt it. But—try. It would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
such a novel sensation. Why, woman alive, if
it weren’t for my sensations I’d be as wooden-y
as you are. Patterson, I’m going to Albuquerque.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you exasperating creature! But—I’ve
just come from there. A few weeks ago,
on our way back from California. That’s the
name of that curious old town that’s so antique
on one side and so horribly new on the other.
Yes, I’m going to Al-bu-quer-que. Why don’t
you ask me what for?”</p>

<p>“You’ll be sure to tell me, directly, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Humph! You <i>are</i> impertinent. I have
always known it. I consider you so when you
don’t get excited.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not. Not a bit sorry. You
didn’t get excited even when I told you I’d
bought our tickets for a trip around the world.
Nothing on the trip excited you. Even when
I talked anarchy in Russia and had to keep my
tongue so still afterward. You’re not excited
now, yet—if I chose—I could say that which
would make even your smooth hair stand up
and ruffle itself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>“I dare say so, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Patterson, am I a happy woman?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I done a lot of good in my life?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had bitter sorrows. They’ve made
me—disagreeable, eh? Well, listen. Once a
man borrowed my money and died without
paying it. Because of that debt, which I half-forgot,
and their silly notions of honor his
family have always been poor. I didn’t know
they worried so—until it was too late. Then
I let it go on. It was less trouble than the
other way. And exertion is good for—other
people. Patterson! leave tidying this room
and sit down.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. It often is ‘too late’ in this
world.”</p>

<p>“Why—Patterson! I say, leave tidying
the room. You’re always at it when you
aren’t ‘eating your tea,’ and I’ve something to
tell you, Patterson! <i>Sit down!</i> I bid you.
I’ve that to tell you that will, that must, wake
you up at last.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” and something in her mistress’s
manner did catch the attention of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
faithful old servant, of long service and short
speech.</p>

<p>“Good Patterson—Do you remember
Mary?”</p>

<p>Then, indeed, did the “worm turn.”</p>

<p>“Remember Mary? How can you ask me
that? Wasn’t I her nurse? Wasn’t she the
sweetest girl who ever lived? Didn’t I love
her like my own soul? Ah! indeed, but I do
remember Mary. It was I who dressed her for
her wedding, which you’d forbidden. <i>Do I—remember—Mary?</i>”</p>

<p>“There, there. That was fine. Magnificent.
I thought there was fire in you somewhere,
if a body only had gunpowder enough
about her to set it flashing. Well—I, too,
remember Mary. Ah! Patterson! how well!”</p>

<p>Only one who knew the erratic Mrs. Sinclair,
as Patterson knew her, could have understood
that sudden change in her manner which bespoke
a broken heart. “Mary.” The never
forgotten, the always beloved, the forever
mourned. In that love and in that self-reproachful
memory, lay the secret of this strange
and restless life.</p>

<p>The little old lady, whose face was wizened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
and wan, dropped into her chair and Patterson
went and stood beside her.</p>

<p>“There, ma’am. I wouldn’t. It’s all past
and gone. There’s still a heaven where you
can meet her, even though, as you said, it’s
too late for this world.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sinclair bobbed her head, then looked
up with a gleam in her eye. “It was you who
said that, Patterson.”</p>

<p>“Was it, ma’am? I don’t remember that.”</p>

<p>“Listen. When I came home from the Pacific,
as usual, I got out at all the stations to
rest myself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“At one of them, called Tuttle, which was
just a man or two, a water-tank and a house,
with a few other folks thrown in—at this
wretched spot I saw—two children.”</p>

<p>“So you said, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, I said nothing of the kind. I
never mentioned it. <i>Somebody</i> said they were
Indian captives, just rescued. When I looked
at them something went through my heart like
a shot. Those children made me think of
Mary. They had eyes like Mary’s. And—<i>Patterson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span> 
sit down</i>. You’ll need support
now.”</p>

<p>Patterson immediately dropped upon a
lounge, but continued to dust little portions of
the furniture near, with a silk rag she pulled
from her pocket and went nowhere without.
But she suddenly ceased her labor and—waked
up entirely!</p>

<p>“Hear this Associated Press dispatch. I
was right. Those little ‘captives’ I saw are
my Mary’s children. It all fits together like a
sliced puzzle—when once you start it right.
Hark!”</p>

<p>Then in her clear tones, still unimpaired by
age, and in an excitement that was now really
healthful, Mrs. Sinclair read to her old attendant
the same account of the famous “Discovery”
which the hospital nurse had read to her
convalescing patient.</p>

<p>She read it once at almost breakneck speed,
then again, more slowly; and at its conclusion,
Patterson stood beside the door leading into
the dressing room, impatient to be gone.</p>

<p>“Patterson, where are you? What are you
about? <i>Why don’t you—sit down?</i> Where can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
you be going in such frightful haste? Eh?
What did you say?”</p>

<p>“To pack our trunks. <i>I’m</i> going to Albuquerque.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Wide awake at last! You’re right.
<i>We</i> are going by the first express, to Mary’s
children at Albuquerque!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIII<br>

<small>REFUGIO ONCE MORE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Rupert Disbrow so excitedly sprang
from his chair and threw down the evening
paper that his father, calmly reading his own
<i>Gazette</i> at the other side of the library table,
ejaculated:</p>

<p>“Rupert, what has become of your self-control?
My nerves—They were bad enough before
we took that wretched trip to the jumping-off-place
of creation, but now—I must have
quiet and rest, at least in my own house.”</p>

<p>“But a little excitement of the right sort, will
do you good, father. Listen, please. I’ll read
you something and try to do so quietly.”</p>

<p>“You act queerly, for a lawyer—”</p>

<p>“Yes, a lawyer, of course; but first—a man.
I defy anybody to be composed, who has had
the experience we’ve had, chasing over half
this wide country in pursuit of something and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
returning to find it right here in his own
library—”</p>

<p>Now seriously alarmed by the strange manner
of his usually sedate son, the elder gentleman
rose to ring the bell and send for his man,
feeling that he would know, at once, if aught
were seriously amiss with the “boy,” who
acted as if he, too, had caught the fever which
had detained them so long in the southwest and
from which the father had nearly died.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Ring, if you need anything
for yourself, but I—well, I’ll just wire a
few words to Mrs. Sinclair, then read you what
will make you stare.”</p>

<p>“Rupert, for peace’s sake, don’t stir up that
old woman, to-night. We’re not at the office
and it’s past business hours—”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, father, but it’s a case of
‘needs must.’ And I won’t stop to wire.
Since you’ve summoned your man I’ll send the
message direct to her house.”</p>

<p>The messenger was hastily dispatched and
then the younger lawyer read that same “Associated
Press” article which had already startled
so many other people into hasty action.
When it was finished, Mr. George Disbrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
leaned back and sighed in vast relief, saying:</p>

<p>“Well! If anything in this topsy-turvy
world could surprise me that story would. It
seems incredible, but I’m only too thankful to
believe it. It will ‘settle’ our whimsical client
as nothing less amazing would; and end for
us a ‘case’ that has been much more plague
than profit.”</p>

<p>“But how strange that Mr. Manuel has
never been heard from! What is your theory
in the matter?”</p>

<p>“A capable lawyer never indulges in theories.
He sticks to facts. What now?”</p>

<p>A servant entered and delivered a note to
the old gentleman, who took it, protesting
against further disturbance of his rest time.
Then, as he recognized the handwriting on the
envelope, his expression altered to one as excited
as that of his son.</p>

<p>“Of all things! A note from the very man
we were discussing and at the very moment!
Hear this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“‘<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>‘Having for some months been absent from
my home, in hospital in this city and extremely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
ill, I knew nothing of what has transpired at
Refugio until to-night. I refer you to the
evening papers to explain why I start for
Albuquerque, immediately, without delaying to
call upon you at your office. I will communicate
with you from that town.</p>

<p class="right">‘Yours truly, <span class="smcap">Adrian Manuel</span>.’”</p>
</div>

<p>“Well, father, I think that’s decent of the
gentleman, and satisfactory. He always has
been punctilious and correct in his few dealings
with us. I’ll write that Miguel. Theirs is an
out of the way place, but a letter will reach
there—give it time. Hold on! I’ve an idea.
Business isn’t pressing at this season of the
year, and I’ll run out to Albuquerque myself.
I’d give a big sum to see those children safe
again and make them understand I’m not the
terrible ogre who so nearly scared them to
death. Was that another knock? Yes.
Come in.”</p>

<p>It was his own messenger, returned, bringing
him a reply, short and sharp, like its
writer:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Yours received. I’m taking matters into
my own hands. I leave for Albuquerque on
the seven o’clock, limited.</p>

<p class="right">Mary Sinclair.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Good for the old lady! I’ll meet her on the
train. We’ll journey together to Albuquerque.”</p>

<p>So there came a goodly company winding
down from the hills into the valley of Refugio.
Never, since the days of the old Padres, had
such a cavalcade appeared there, seeking shelter
in the blessed House of Refuge.</p>

<p>Old Guadalupo, still basking in the sun before
the kitchen door, blinked and called to
Marta:</p>

<p>“Put on the pot, old woman! Bring your
guitar and sing your shrillest. They are
coming! By the ears of my spirit I hear
them.”</p>

<p>Too glad to hobble, as she used to do, Marta
flew to the threshold. Age seemed to have left
and joy transformed her.</p>

<p>“Ah, soul of my life, I have, I have! Already,
there is seethed the flesh of the kid, and
there are baked the cakes and sweeties that my
children love. Loaves? Why, heart’s dearest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
you have never seen such loaves! But, Anita?
An-i-ta!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, <i>madre mia</i>, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Where is that boy, Miguel?”</p>

<p>Coquettish for the first time since these
many, many days, the maid shrugged her pretty
shoulders and settled a rose in her dark hair,
as she answered:</p>

<p>“Where? How should I know?”</p>

<p>“Know? Since he returned from that unhappy
search of his—know? Why, minion,
you know more of my boy, Miguel, now-a-days,
than the mother who bore him. Yet, mark my
words! He has a temper! Ah! yes. When
you are his wife, let the folds of his silken shirt
be creased the wrong way but once and I tell
you— Oh! Have a care!”</p>

<p>“For a woman, breathless, there are many
words, <i>madre</i>. But I am glad to know. That
shirt—it shall be ever rightly creased. <i>Si.</i>
But to-day he has no eyes for me. He has already
gone, flown upon that Amador, to meet
those who come. I? I cannot wait! How
can I? Nor—need I! For—they come, they
come! <i>Hola!</i> But the House of Refuge will
be full this night! and the <i>fiesta</i> we will make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
shall last for days and days. Behold, my
mother, what a company is this that comes from
Albuquerque!”</p>

<p>“Where is that Pablo? Here. He shall
stand here with us. Is every <i>vaquero</i> in place?
Fall into line, there! For not a single soul
upon the Master’s rancho shall fail to bid him
welcome when he comes once more unto his own.
I have said it, I, Anita. So it must be. And
now— They come! Give them true Spanish
welcome—lusty and from the heart: <i>Bien
Venido! Bien! BIEN!!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Truly, they had “come.” Adrian Manuel,
his children on either side; the Burnhams,
“root and branch”; Rupert Disbrow, glad as a
boy to be back at Refugio in such happy times;
Patterson of the terse speech and loyal heart;
Mistress Mary Sinclair, riding in a carriage of
honor, gay as a girl, forgiving and forgiven,
at last one with the family for whom her soul
had pined; Dennis, in gorgeous garb, befitting a
gentleman of Connemara; and last, a woman in
Pueblo dress—Paula; whose keen eyes saw her
son restored—Pablo, the Dancer.</p>

<p>But, as this joyful company neared the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
Mission, it diverged to a sunny spot, marvellously
cared for and rich in blooming plants
and waving palms. There Adrian Manuel and
his children leaped down, to kneel in that beloved
place where the Lady of Refugio slept;
and, understanding without words, the last bitterness
passed from old Mary Sinclair’s heart
as she silently stepped down and also reverently
knelt beside the trio.</p>

<p>It was a mute petition to the living and the
dead; and the living answered for the dead, as
Carlota folded her arms about the aged woman
and kissed her—“for Mary.”</p>
